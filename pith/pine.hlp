         Help text for the Alpine mailer

This file is in a format created to be turned into text strings in a C
program.

There are two shell scripts that run on this.  Cmplhelp.sh is the
first and turns this into a C file (helptext.c) of text strings that
are compiled and linked. The other program, cmplhlp2.sh, turns this
into a .h file (helptext.h) with extern string definitions of the
strings in the .c file.  The code that actually processes these files
while alpine is running is in help.c

The lines with "===== xxxx ====" divide the different help screens.  The
xxx is the name of the variable that strings will be put in, which are
also declared in helptext.h.

# is a comment

Help text screen text can be either plain text OR HTML.  The latter is
denoted by the first line starting with "<HTML>".  The former is simply
displayed as it's formatted here.

HTML is limited to simple formatting ala HTML 2.0.  No forms, or tables.
In addition a small set of tools are are available to customize the HTML
screen's text:

1a)  Default and function key bindings are separated like this:

<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
	Function key bindings here
<!--chtml else-->
	Default key bindings here
<!--chtml endif-->


1b)  A way to distinguish HTML text that is to be displayed when
     pine is running vs. when the text is served up outside Alpine
     (someday) can be done via:

<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
   Text displayed when viewed within a running pine session
<!--chtml else-->
   Text displayed when HTML viewed outside pine (using chtml aware server)
<!--chtml endif-->

1c)  A way to distinguish HTML text that is to be displayed under
     PC-Alpine vs. not is available via:

<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
   Text displayed under PC-Alpine
<!--chtml else-->
   Text displayed otherwise
<!--chtml endif-->

WARNING ABOUT CHTML "if-else-endif" CLAUSES: They don't nest.

2a) Several "server side include" commented elements are supported:

<!--#include file="textfile"--> 

The file "textfile" will be inserted into the HTML text directly.
Alpine does no formatting of the text.  At some point we might want to
look at the first line for <HTML> but not today.

2b) Various bits of Alpine's running state can be inserted into the
HTML text as well using the special comment:

<!--#echo var="variable"--> 

Where "variable" is one of either:

    ALPINE_VERSION
    ALPINE_REVISION
    ALPINE_COMPILE_DATE
    ALPINE_TODAYS_DATE
    C_CLIENT_VERSION
    _LOCAL_FULLNAME_
    _LOCAL_ADDRESS_
    _BUGS_FULLNAME_
    _BUGS_ADDRESS_
    CURRENT_DIR
    HOME_DIR
    PINE_CONF_PATH
    PINE_CONF_FIXED_PATH
    PINE_INFO_PATH
    MAIL_SPOOL_PATH
    MAIL_SPOOL_LOCK_PATH
    VAR_<VARNAME> - where <VARNAME> is config variable name
    FEAT_<FEATURENAME> - where <FEATURENAME> is config feature name

3) The URL scheme "X-Alpine-Gripe:" is available to insert links to
   pine's composer such that various debugging data can be attached to the
   message. Aside from normal email addresses, this can be set to
   either "_LOCAL_ADDRESS_" for the configured local help address, or
   "_BUGS_ADDRESS_" for the configured local bug reporting address.
   Aside from the special tokens above, the default behavior only differs
   from "mailto:" by the insertion of a special Subject: prefix that
   consists of a randomly-generated token for tracking purposes.
   Several optional parameters can be included to control what is
   attached or offered for attachment to the message:

        ?config  --  Automatically attaches the user's configuration
                     information to the trouble report
        ?keys    --  Automatically attaches the user's most recent
                     keystrokes
        ?curmsg  --  Causes the user to get an offer to attach the
                     current message to the trouble report
        ?local   --  Automatically attaches the result of the script 
                     defined by VAR_BUGS_EXTRAS

For HTML-format sections, the help screen dividers  "===== xxxx ====" must 
contain one and only one space after the first and before the second set of 
equal signs.

Note to authors of this file: to mark sections that need further revision, 
please use the text string on the following line consistently so that it is 
easy to find those places again in this file:
*revision needed*

NOTE: Several sections of help text which weren't being used were removed
at RCS version number 4.122.  In particular, there were some placeholders
with help text for the config screen and the composer that didn't have any
reasonable place to be called from.

<P>
Alpine is an &quot;Alternatively Licensed Program for Internet
News and Email&quot; produced until 2009 by the University of Washington.
It is intended to be an easy-to-use program for
sending, receiving, and filing Internet electronic mail messages and
bulletin board (Netnews) messages.  Alpine is designed to run on a wide
variety of Unix&reg; operating systems.  A version for Microsoft Windows&reg;
is available as is a world wide web based version designed to run under the
Apache web server.


<H2>New in Alpine <!--#echo var="ALPINE_VERSION"--> (<!--#echo var="ALPINE_REVISION"-->)</H2>

Version <!--#echo var="ALPINE_VERSION"--> (<!--#echo var="ALPINE_REVISION"-->)
addresses bugs found in previous releases and has a few additions as well.

<P>
Additions include:

<UL>
<LI> Support for <A HREF="h_xoauth2">XOAUTH2</A> authentication method in Gmail.

<LI> PC-Alpine builds with LibreSSL and supports S/MIME.

<LI> NTLM authentication support with the ntlm library, in Unix systems.
Based on code provided by Maciej W. Rozycki.

<LI> Add /tls1_3 flag for servers that support it. Read more information
in the secure protocols <A HREF="h_network_encryption_security">help</A>.

<LI> New variable 
<A HREF="h_config_encryption_range"><!--#echo var="VAR_encryption-protocol-range"--></A> 
that allows users to configure versions of the SSL/TLS protocol that Alpine is 
restricted to try when establishing a secure connection SSL/TLS to a remote 
server. The default can be set at compilation time.

<LI> Add -dict option to PC-Pico, which allows users to choose a dictionary
when spelling. Sample usage: -dict "en_US, de_DE, fr_FR".

<LI> Improvements to the configure stage of compilation. Some of
these contributed by Helmut Grohne. See
<A href="https://bugs.debian.org/876164">Bug 876164</A> in Debian.

<LI> Add &quot;remove password&quot; command to the management screen for the 
password file encryption key. This allows users to use their password file
without entering a master password.

<LI> Add the &quot;g&quot; option to the select command that works in IMAP 
servers that implement the X-GM-EXT-1 capability (such as the one offered 
by Gmail.) This allows users to do selection in Alpine as if they were 
doing a search in the web interface for Gmail.

<LI> New variable close-connection-timeout, which tells Alpine to close
a connection that is having problems being kept alive after the number
of seconds configured in this variable, if the connection has not
recovered. The default is 0, which means to keep the connection alive
and wait for the connection to recover.

<LI> When a message is of type multipart/mixed, and its first part is
multipart/signed, Alpine will include the text of the original message
in a reply message, instead of including a multipart attachment.
Suggested by Barry Landy.

<LI> S/MIME: Some clients do not transform messages to canonical form when 
signing first and encrypting second, which makes Alpine fail to parse the 
signed data after encryption. Reported by Holger Trapp.

<LI> Add /auth=XYZ to the way to define a server. This allows users to  
select the method to authenticate to an IMAP, SMTP or POP3 server.
Examples are /auth=plain, or /auth=gssapi, etc.

<LI> Add backward search in the index screen. Based on patch by Astyanax Foo, 
submitted in 2009, but resubmitted by Erich Eckner on 2019.

<LI> SMIME: When Alpine is set to validate a message using the user's store, and
     user agrees to save a certificate of another user, use the saved 
     certificate immediately to verify the smime message. Reported by 
     Stefan Mueller.

<LI> Do not use a delay when printing messages to screen when the initial
     keystroke sequence of commands is active. Based on a report from Holger
     Trapp.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs that have been addressed include:
<UL>
   <LI> Width of characters is not always determined correctly when wcwidth
        is used. Revert to using code for the Windows operating system. 
        Reported by Andrew Ho.

   <LI> The call realpath(..., NULL) gives an error in Solaris, which means that
        we need to allocate memory for storing the resolved path. Reported by
        Fabian Schmidt.

   <LI> Crash when attempting to bounce a message due to lack of space in
        allocated space for key menu array. Reported by David Sewell.

   <LI> Crash when a CA certificate failed to load, and user attempted to
        view certificate information of other certificate authorities.

   <LI> Crash in the S/MIME configuration screen when a user turned off S/MIME, and
        then reenabled it. Also crash when attempting to enter the S/MIME 
        configuration screen if S/MIME was turned off.

   <LI> Deactivate some color code from Pico (as standalone editor in the
        windows version) until I find a way to activate it again. This is 
        not critical and it is not something that PC-Pico must have (some 
        of it already exists in other ways, like color support, what does 
        not exist is the more complex code that Unix-Pico has with color 
        codes for specific colors.)

   <LI> When a message is multipart, and the first part is flowed text, 
        then forwarding the message will set the first part to be flowed, 
        and sent that way even when the option Do Not Send Flowed Text is 
        enabled. Reported by Holger Trapp.

   <LI> When a message/rfc822 part of a message is encoded with
        Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE, Alpine will stop 
        processing that message. Later this causes Alpine to crash because 
        when it displays messages, it assumes that both header and body 
        parts are processed. Reported by Mark Crispin in 2010, in the 
        Alpine-info list (message with subject "crash bug in 
        alpine/mailpart.c:format_msg_att()") with no example, and reported 
        now by Holger Trapp, with an example.

   <LI> In addition to the previous report, Alpine encodes message/rfc822
        messages as QUOTED-PRINTABLE, in contradiction with RFC 2045, 
        when it receives a report that its encoding is 8bit. We preserve 
        the encoding reported by the IMAP server, and do not encode in 
        QUOTED-PRINTABLE.

   <LI> Update build.bat file to add /DWINVER=0x0501 so that Alpine can 
        build when using Visual Studio 2017. Fix contributed by 
        Ulf-Dietrich Braunmann.

   <LI> When the locale is not set up to UTF-8, alpine might determine the 
        width of a character incorrectly. Reported by Alexandre Fedotov.

   <LI> In some rare cases, when attachments are deleted before saving 
        emails, the filenames will be displayed in RFC1522 representation, 
        instead of in decoded form. Reported and patched by Wang Kang.

   <LI> When colors are edited from the main setup configuration screen, some
        color settings are not updated until Alpine is restarted. Reported by
        Andrew Hill.

   <LI> If the first part of a message is multipart/alternative, and the 
        first part of this is also a multipart type, then Alpine might 
        fail to select the first text part when replying to a message. 
        Reported by Lucio Chiappetti.

   <LI> TLS 1.2 works does not work if Alpine is compiled with openssl &gt;= 1.1.0.
        Reported and patched by Kyle George.

   <LI> If the directory where Alpine saves the certificates is empty,
        alpine would not create a self-signed certificate to encrypt the 
        password file.

   <LI> S/MIME: The list of public certificates is freed before it is 
        reused when a signature fails to verify. This causes Alpine to 
        crash. Patch submitted by Linus Torvalds.

   <LI> S/MIME: A message could fail to verify its signature even if the
        certificate was saved when the message was open. Based on a report 
        by David Woodhouse to the RedHat bugzilla system.

   <LI> When there are time changes in the clock, Alpine might go to sleep
        for big amounts of time while displaying messages in the screen. 
        Reset sleep time to 5 seconds in case it finds it needs to sleep 
        more than 5 seconds or a negative amount of time.

   <LI> Restore recognition of empty directories. It was deleted by mistake
        when added support for internationalization in folders. Based on a 
        report by Michael Rutter.

   <LI> Alpine stops parsing the mailcap file when it finds an invalid entry.
        Reported by Matt Roberds to the Debian bug system at 
        <A HREF="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=886370">https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=886370</A>.
</UL>

<P>
Version 2.21 addresses bugs found in previous releases and has several 
additions as well.

<P>
Additions include:
<UL>
  <LI> PC-Alpine: New configuration option "Aspell Dictionaries" allows a
       user to choose the dictionary used to spell check, in case the user 
       communicates in more than one language. Examples of values for the 
       variable are "en_US" or "de_DE", etc. Only the first 10 
       dictionaries are offered.

  <LI> Unix-Alpine: Connect securely to a LDAP server on a secure port. 
       Based on a contribution by Wang Kang.

  <LI> Colors configured in Alpine are inherited in the composer.

  <LI> When Alpine is compiled with password file and SMIME support 
       the password file is encrypted using a private key/public 
       certificate pair. If one such pair cannot be found, one will be 
       created. <A HREF="h_password_file_support">Learn more</A>.

  <LI> Alpine builds with any version of OpenSSL greater than or equal
       to 1.0.0c. This includes version 1.1.0. Alpine also builds with
       LibreSSL.

  <LI> New SHORTSUBJECT, SHORTSUBJKEY and SHORTSUBJKEYINIT token for index 
       format, which removes text in the SUBJECT between &quot;[&quot; and 
       &quot;]&quot;.

  <LI> New SMARTTIME24 token for index screen. It is close to SMARTDATETIME
       but it differns in that it gives the time in which the message was
       sent for messages that are less than a week old. it uses a 24 hour
       format.

  <LI> Alpine will include attachments when forwarding some 
       multipart/alternative messages for which it did not use to include 
       attachments.

  <LI> New configuration option 
       <a href="h_config_alt_reply_menu"><!--#echo var="FEAT_alternate-reply-menu"--></a>
       which adds more ways to control features and variables when you
       start to reply to a message.

  <LI> Added support for RFC 2971 - IMAP ID extension.

  <LI> Add configuration <A href="h_config_ignore_size"><!--#echo var="FEAT_ignore-size-changes"--></A>
       that allows users to ignore errors in the computation of the size
       of a message from defective servers.

  <LI> SMIME: Upgrade the default signature digest from sha1 to sha-256, since 
       clients such as Thunderbird do not validate signatures that use sha1 digest.

  <LI> Add the configuration variable "default-directories", which is called
       <A href="h_config_history"><!--#echo var="VAR_default-directories"--></A>
       variable saves a list of directories that are readily accessible 
       for save or export of attachments. This makes it easier to save 
       attachments in directories that are hard to navigate to, or that 
       are accessed frequently.

  <LI> When a filename is attached and its name is encoded, the save 
       attachment command will offer to save the file in the encoded form. 
       This might work for some users, but the save command will have a 
       subcommand ^N to decode the file name and save the file with the 
       decoded name.

  <LI> The TAB key allows autocomplete in the Fcc field in the composer headers,
       as well as autocompletes automatically when only one possibility exists 
       for the ^J attach command.

  <LI> Add support for the &quot;TYPE&quot; and &quot;VALUE&quot; attributes of
       the html OL tag.

  <LI> Ignore message from smtp server after a successful authentication
       challenge.

  <LI> When a message is saved in the Form Letter folder, add the ability
       to save the role being used to compose such message so that settings
       such as the SMTP server set in the role can be used when sending
       such form message. Suggested and patched by Frank Doepper.

  <LI> If SSLDIR is defined somehow, do not disable S/MIME if the
       SSLCERTSDIR is not found.

  <LI> When Alpine sends an attachment, it will set the boundary attribute
       in lower case, as some SMTP servers, such as those of libero.it 
       reject messages if the boundary attribute is in uppercase.

  <LI> Add the ability to change the private key and certificates used
       to encrypt a password file in the SMIME setup configuration screen.
       <A HREF="h_config_smime_password_file_certificates">Learn more</A>

  <LI> SMIME: The ctrl-E command that gives information on the certificate
       is only available for messages that have a signed or encrypted 
       part.

  <LI> SMIME: If a message contains a RFC822 attachment that is
       signed/decrypted add the ability to view its SMIME information.

  <LI> SMIME: Certificate information in the S/MIME screen is available 
       for certificates stored in a container.

  <LI> SMIME: Offer the common name of the person, instead of the name of
       file containing the certificate, as the name to be displayed in the 
       certificate management screen for certificate authorities. 
       Suggested by Matthias Rieber.

  <LI> SMIME: Management of several alternate name (SAN) certificates is 
       improved. When importing a SAN certificate, also import a certificate
       for the filename, besides for the e-mail addresses in the
       certificate. Suggested by Matthias Rieber.

  <LI> SMIME: add full year when displaying information about a certificate
       in the certificate management screen. Suggested by Matthias Rieber.

  <LI> SMIME: sort certificates by some type of alphabetical order in the
       displayed name.

  <LI> SMIME: Alpine will ask users if they wish to save S/MIME 
       certificates included in signatures, when the option "Validate 
       Using Certificate Store Only" is enabled. If the user does not wish 
       to save it, validation will fail.

  <LI> HTML: Add support for decoding entities in hexadecimal notation.
       Suggested by Tulip&aacute;nt Gergely.

  <LI> The &quot;#&quot; command, when used as part of an aggregate
       operation will allow users to select the role used in either 
       replying, forwarding or replying to the group of selected messages, 
       Suggested by Hisashi T Fujinaka.

  <LI> If the charset of a message can not be determined, use the value set
       in the <A HREF="h_config_unk_char_set"><!--#echo var="VAR_unknown-character-set"--></A> for its value.

  <LI> Resizing setup screen will redraw screen.

  <LI> Unix Alpine only. Experimental: If Alpine/Pico finds a UCS4 code
       in the width ambiguous zone, it will use other means to determine
       the width, such as call wcwidth.

  <LI> Pico: Code reorganization in the search command to make it easier to
       add subcommands of the search command.

  <LI> Pico: Search command can do a case sensitive match. Use the Ctrl-^
       subcommand of the search command to bring this choice into view.

  <LI> Pico: Add the ability to search for strings in the beginning or end
       of a line. Use the Ctrl-^ subcommand of the search command to bring 
       this choice into view.

  <LI> For a multipart/alternative message, the Take Address command will 
       work on the part that is being read.

  <LI> When sending a message, allow for 512 characters of consecutive 
       non-white space before folding the subject line.

  <LI> Make sure titlebar (the line at the top of the screen) always 
       contains the name of the folder/newsgroup that is open, if this 
       fits in the title.

  <LI> The feature <a href="h_config_scramble_message_id">FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_scramble-message-id"--></a>
       will also scramble the name, version and operating system in the 
       message-id header. Based on a contribution by Dennis Davis, which 
       is itself based on a contribution by Mark Hills.

  <LI> Change in logic in imap_set_password function to make Alpine ask if
       a user wants to save a password before reading the password file.

  <LI> When exporting all parts of a message, if two attachments have the same
       name, do not overwrite a file more than once, but instead add a counter
       number to the filename to make a new file that does not exist in the file
       system.

  <LI> Add the Control-R subcommand to the save command for attachments. 
       This subcommand toggles if the saving will be done in binary mode 
       for text attachments. When a user saves an attachment using binary
       mode it will be saved as it was sent, otherwise the attachment will
       be transformed to UTF-8 for further transformation through internal
       and user defined filters for saving.

  <LI> Add command line argument -smimedir, which allows to specify
       the default path for a directory that contains the public, private, 
       and ca directories. This is useful in case a user has a backup of 
       old certificates that cannot be installed in the ~/.alpine-smime 
       dir.

  <LI> Reimplementation of the code that allows the .pinerc file to be a
       symbolic link by Kyle George from tcpsoft.com to use realpath.

  <LI> When saving an attachment, the "^T" command leads to a screen where the
       "A" command can be used to add a file. A directory can be added by
       pressing "^X" after the "A" command. Added after a suggestion by
       Stefan Goessling.

  <LI> When saving an attachment, the ^Y and ^V commands allow a user to 
       scroll through the history of directories used to save attachments, 
       while preserving the given name of the file. Suggested by Peter 
       Koellner.

  <LI> SMIME: Turn off automatic signing and encrypting of a message when
       bouncing. Suggested after a discussion with Matthias Rieber.

  <LI> When messages are selected, warn the user if a message that is not
       selected will be bounced, or if not all selected messages will be 
       bounced. Suggested by Ulf-Dietrich Braumann.

  <LI> The bounce command adds a subcommand to choose a role.

  <LI> When selecting messages by number, the &quot;.&quot; character can 
       be used to specify the message on which the cursor is on.

  <LI> When Alpine opens an attachment, it sometimes changes the extension 
       of the file that is being opened and replaces it by another for the 
       same mime type. If Alpine finds that the extension of the file 
       corresponds with the mime type, according to the mime-types file, 
       then it will keep it, and no substitution will be made.

  <LI> Set no restrictions on the length of encoded subjects, but encode
       words in length of no more than 75 characters.
</UL>

 
<P>
Bugs that have been addressed include:
<UL>
  <LI> SMIME: Crash when a certificate has an invalid date of validity. Also
       Alpine will use the function ASN1_TIME_print to determine the date 
       of validity. Reported by Ben Stienstra.

  <LI> SMIME: Crash when attempting to unlock the password file and an
       incorrect password is entered.

  <LI> SMIME: Crash when checking the signature of a message that contains
       a RFC822 attached message. Reported by Holger Trapp and Bj&ouml;rn 
       Krellner.

  <LI> SMIME: Cancelling entering password to unlock key will not reprompt.

  <LI> SMIME: fix a bug that did not allow users to transfer certificates to
       remote containers. Reported by Matthias Rieber.

  <LI> SMIME: certificates included in messages were not being transferred
       to a remote container.

  <LI> SMIME: Crash if public certificates are located in an inaccessible
       remote server and the private key is not available.

  <LI> SMIME: Alpine does not remove temporary files created when adding a 
       CA certificate to a container. Reported by Holger Trapp.

  <LI> SMIME: When reading a local certificate, Alpine converts the name 
       of the certificate to lowercase, which may make Alpine not be able 
       to read such certificate. Reported by Dennis Davis.

  <LI> SMIME: If the option "Remember S/MIME Passphrase" is disabled, then
       entering a password to read an encrypted message will make Alpine 
       forget the key and not ask the password to unlock it again in case 
       it is necessary to unlock it again. Reported by Ulf-Dietrich 
       Braumann.

  <LI> Alpine would use freed memory while trying to compute the color
       of the titlebar. This happened when trying to continue a postponed 
       message.

  <LI> Alpine failed to read an encrypted password file if too many
       passwords were saved in the password file.

  <LI> When selecting messages while in Threaded Index Screen, some 
       messages other than top of threads could appear in the index, making
       Alpine display messages &quot;out of the screen.&quot;

  <LI> The index format would be chopped at the position of an unrecognized 
       token, instead of skipping the token as intended.

  <LI> Work in progress: Avoid calling non-safe functions when Alpine
       receives a signal. See bug report 
       <A HREF="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=825772">here.</A>

  <LI> Crash when attempting to read a message after a bounce command. 
       In order to produce a crash one needed to use the ^T subcommand and 
       do a search in a LDAP directory. The crash is produced by changes 
       to the text in the title bar. Reported by Heinrich Mislik in the 
       Alpine-info list.

  <LI> HTML messages that contain UTF-8 may wrap at the wrong position,
       making Alpine not display the correct character at the position 
       that wrapping is done. Reported by Wang Kang.

  <LI> Pico: Searching for a string that is too long causes Pico to crash
       in the next search.

  <LI> Fix vulnerability in regex library. This only affects those who use
       this library, such as the windows version of Alpine. See 
       <A HREF="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/695940">http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/695940</A>
       for more details.

  <LI> Alpine would not set include and lib paths for OpenSSL if this was
       installed in /usr/local/ssl.

  <LI> If the .pinerc file is a symbolic link, Alpine might not write its
       contents when saving its configuration.

  <LI> The _INIT_ token does not skip over non-alphanumeric characters in
       the name. Reported by Andreas Fehr.

  <LI> When opening an INBOX folder in a context different from the 
       incoming folders collection, from the command line, Alpine would 
       open the INBOX folder from the incoming folders collection.

  <LI> Mismatch in size of UCS and CELL caused a corruption in the
       content of a pointer, which made the speller in PC-Alpine get the 
       content of a word incorrectly.

  <LI> Skip testing openssl compatibility version when cross-compilation
       is detected. Fix contributed by Antti Sepp&auml;l&auml;

  <LI> Alpine fails to remove temporary files used during a display or sending
       filter. Fix contributed by Phil Brooke.

  <LI> When the index is in zoomed state, adding new messages to the 
       selection would not show those messages if those messages are on 
       top of the current message in the top of the screen. Reported by
       Ulf-Dietrich Braumann. In addition, when the user scrolls through
       the index, this scroll smoothly, without jumping pages. Reported
       by Holger Trapp.

  <LI> Crash when reviewing history of saving attachments.

  <LI> Crash when canceling a goto command on a local collection that has
       not been expanded and attempting to expand such collection.

  <LI> Crash in Pico when forwarding messages that contain a direction mark
       at the end of a line. Reported by James Mingo.

  <LI> Solve compilation errors when Alpine is built with Visual Studio 2015.
</UL>


<P>
Version 2.20 addresses bugs found in previous releases and has several 
additions as well.

<P>
Additions include:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI> Upgrade UW-IMAP to Panda IMAP from 
       <A HREF="https://github.com/jonabbey/panda-imap">https://github.com/jonabbey/panda-imap</A>.
  <LI> S/MIME: Add screen to manage certificates.
  <LI> S/MIME: Signatures are validated using the user's certificates instead
       of the ones included in the message. Behavior can be disabled by
       disabling the option <A href="h_config_smime_use_cert_store">
	<!--#echo var="FEAT_smime-use-storey-only"--></A>, which is enabled
       by default.
  <LI> S/MIME: sign messages using intermediate certificates when needed 
       and possible.
  <LI> S/MIME: validation of certificates for servers that modify signed 
       content.
  <LI> S/MIME: signed and encrypted messages will be signed first and 
       encrypted second, so that they can be decoded by other clients.
  <LI> S/MIME: add the sender certificate to the list of certificates in
       encrypted messages to make it possible for the sender to decrypt
       the message they sent.
  <LI> S/MIME: When transferring certificates to a local container, create 
       container with default names PublicContainer, PrivateContainer and 
       CAContainer, as appropriate for these files, unless the user has 
       provided some other names.
  <LI> S/MIME: Forwarding a message will include the signed part as part
       of the text and not as a multipart message, just as the reply
       command does.
  <LI> HTML: Style tag in body of html message causes Alpine to not write
       its content until a new &lt;/style&gt;
  <LI> HTML: &lt;BR&gt;, &lt;BR /&gt;, and &lt;BR/&gt; are considered
       the same inline tag; the same is valid for the &lt;HR&gt; tag.
  <LI> Add support to selective expunge through a subcommand of the 
       select-apply commands. Read more in the <A 
       HREF="h_index_cmd_expunge">help</A> for the expunge command.
  <LI> Pico: New subcommand of the search command, allows to reverse the
       direction of search.
  <LI> Unix Alpine: If a password file is defined, and S/MIME is enabled, 
       the key and certificate used to encrypt the password file are saved 
       in the ~/.alpine-smime/.pwd directory, or in the directory specified
       by the -pwdcertdir command line option. 
       <A HREF="h_password_file_support">Learn more</A>.
  <LI> Add /tls1, /tls1_1, /tls1_2 and /dtls1 to the definition of a 
       server to use different ways to connect using ssl, for 
       example {server.com/tls1} will attempt to connect to 
       server.com at the ssl imap port (port 993) and establish a 
       connection using TLSv1. These flags can be used in 
       conjunction with the /ssl flag, the ssl flag is redundant. 
       Conversely, however, the /ssl flag does not imply any of 
       these flags; the /ssl flag means SSLv3 or, if not available, 
       SSLv2 in the SSL port.
  <LI> Alpine does not attempt to automatically reopen a collection 
       that was not opened due to cancellation by the user. 
       Instead, the user must try to open it explicitly.
  <LI> Alpine searches for a certificate that matches an email address in
       all addresses in a certificate (instead of just the first 
       one) but when it tries to unlock the certificate, it asks 
       for the password for the first email address in that 
       certificate.
  <LI> Style tag in body of html message causes Alpine to not write its content
       until a new &lt;/style&gt;
  <LI> Experimental: Write the content-type of a message in 
       lowercase, as some non-compliant servers do not understand 
       uppercase content-type, such as those of GMX.de.
  <LI> Experimental: Do not send the RSET command before attempting
       to send a message, as this causes a delay in some evily managed
       servers.
  <LI> Opening a folder updates recent count in maildrops (this 
       already works for other types of folders)
  <LI> Automatically redraw screen after opening an attachment 
       instead of simply clearing it.
  <LI> Pico: Justification works without need of a predefined quote 
       string. This allows justification of blocks of text that are 
       indented with spaces.
  <LI> Decode the name of attachment names, so they can be written as part   
       of the description of the part. 
  <LI> Check bounds and tie strings off to improve security. Contributed 
       by James Jerkins.
  <LI> Replace tabs by spaces in From and Subject fields to control for
       size in screen of these fields. Change only in index screen display.
  <LI> Aggregate operations allows bouncing a list of messages using a role.
       Suggested by Ulf-Dietrich Braumann.
  <LI> Disable saving new passwords to the password file. Implemented
       by Louis Raphael from dpslabs.com. <A HREF="h_config_disable_password_file_saving">Learn more.</A>
  <LI> Makefile: Add $(LIBINTL) to the flags to link rpdump, rpload, 
     alpined and alpineldap because MAC OSX 10.8 x86_64 needs it. Reported by
     Charles M. Register.
</UL>


<P>
Bugs that have been addressed include:
<UL>
  <LI> Fix _INIT_ token for reply quote string to include support for 8-bit
       in personal names. Reported by Lev Gorenstein.
  <LI> When writing the .pinerc file, lines were truncated if they were longer
       than 10,000 characters. This could cause data corruption, so now lines
       are allowed to be of any length.
  <LI> In Unix Alpine (but not in MAC OSX) fix a problem that made Alpine 
       remove attachments before they were open by a mailcap viewer. It 
       requires that the user has an equivalent to a command such as "ps 
       auxww" to list the list of processes, and check if there is any 
       program using the attachment. The default is "/bin/ps auxww", but 
       it can be changed at compile time with the option --with-ps-cmd. 
       See the help of the variable 
       <a href="h_config_psleep"><!--#echo var="VAR_mailcap-check-interval"--></a> 
       for more information.
  <LI> S/MIME: signed messages that contained an attachment would not validate.
  <LI> S/MIME: signed and encrypted messages from Thunderbird would not 
       validate. Thanks to Andreas Schamanek for testing, debugging and 
       advising during the process of fixing this problem.
  <LI> S/MIME: Forwarding messages with multipart content-type failed to be signed
       with &quot;Error writing pipe&quot; message. Reported by Andreas Schamanek
       and Stefan Mueller.
  <LI> S/MIME: Certificates are lost when using a pinerc file outside of the 
       home directory.
  <LI> S/MIME: Accessing the S/MIME configuration screen would deinitialize
       SMIME making it not possible to sign or encrypt messages.
  <LI> S/MIME: Forwarding a signed message might make the body contain mime 
       information that is not part of the body, and hence making the body
       of the message seem wrong.
  <LI> S/MIME Alpine would compute incorrectly the signature of a message 
       that contains 8bit if the option "Enable 8bit ESMTP Negotiation" is 
       enabled, the message contains 8bit characters and the smtp server 
       supports 8bit sending.
  <LI> When replying to several messages, subject will be decoded first,
       and then stripped from re/fwd before they are compared to determine
       the subject of the replied message.
  <LI> Crash when tcp connection to NNTP server was lost after connection
       had been established, but lost immediately afterwards.
  <LI> Crash with message &quot;lock when already locked&quot;, when painting
       an index was based on scores that needed information from a remote
       addressbook in the same server as the folder opened. Reported by
       Peter Koellner.
  <LI> Crash in message/rfc822 attachments encoded in base64.
  <LI> Postponed messages whose content-type is text/html, text/enriched and
       text/richtext are sent with that content-type, even though, after
       resuming composition, Alpine had changed its type to text/plain.
  <LI> Alpine cannot handle correctly some characters in the Windows-1256 
       character set, which might lead to a crash or a corruption in the 
       screen. Work was done to contain the bug. A more complete fix will 
       be done in a future release. Reported by Professor Robert Funnell.
  <LI> WebAlpine: add _GNU_SOURCE to make pubcookie build.
  <LI> WebAlpine: fail to build with debug disabled. Fix from Sam Hathaway.
  <LI> Save command did not warn of existence of a message with a deleted 
       attachment in an aggregate save, unless cursor was positioned on a message 
       with a deleted attachment. Reported by Florian Herzig.
  <LI> Transformation of UTF-8 to MUTF7 was not being done when creating a folder
       in an IMAP server.
  <LI> DATE tokens were not internally transformed to UTF-8, which made their
       values not appear complete in the screen. Reported by Werner Scheinast.
  <LI> Fixes to configure script so that it will not require PAM for every system.
  <LI> Fix to configure script so that it will use CPPFLAGS instead of 
       CPPCFLAGS, and so the --with-ssl-include-dir option take effect 
       during the build. Fix by Ulf-Dietrich Braumann.
  <LI> Fix in WebAlpine: do not use deprecated dereference in pointer, 
       needs to use tcl_getstringresult() instead. Reported by 
       Ulf-Dietrich Braumann.
  <LI> Quoted string in URL Viewers configuration variable were not 
       unquoted before passing to viewer.
  <LI> Fix in configure script to detect location of tcl library; add
       /usr/local in FreeBSD and fix a bug in configure script that used 
       $alpine_TCLINC instead of $alpine_TCLINC/tcl.h. Reported and fixed 
       by Werner Scheinast.
  <LI> Move SSL configurations from UW-IMAP to configure script, and
       update OpenSSL configuration for Mac OS X.
  <LI> Remove -lregex from linker flags when building --with-supplied-regex.
  <LI> When the download of an attachment is interrumpted, Alpine stills
     caches what was downloaded, making the download incomplete for 
     subsequent calls of Alpine attempting to open the attachment. In the 
     future, Alpine will not cache any downloaded part of the attachment 
     when it is interrupted.

<UL>
   <LI> Redesigned Web Alpine interface
   <LI> Experimental <A HREF="h_mainhelp_smime">S/MIME support</A> added
	in UNIX versions of Alpine
   <LI> Attempt to include the attachment filename as part of the name of the
	temporary file used when viewing an attachment with an external program.
	Add some randomness to that filename to make it hard to predict the filename.
	Add a filename extension, usually derived from the type/subtype, to the
	temporary filename. This was previously done only on Windows and MacOS X.
   <LI> Enhance address completion in the composer (TAB command) so that it looks
	through nicknames, fullnames, and addresses from the address book; addresses
	from the message being viewed, if any; and the results from
	<A HREF="h_direct_config">LDAP Directory Server</A>
	lookups for all of the defined directory servers that have the
	<A HREF="h_config_ldap_opts_impl">&quot;Use-Implicitly-From-Composer&quot;</A>
	feature set.
   <LI> Make the default character set setting more liberal in what it will accept
	from the UNIX nl_langinfo call and the various values of LANG seen in the wild
   <LI> Remove the Alpine revision number from the titlebar in released versions
	while leaving it there in snapshot versions
   <LI> Add a <A HREF="h_config_quell_asterisks">feature</A> to suppress the

   <LI> Make Web Alpine help text images relative for more portability
   <LI> Fixed attach save of html parts in Web Alpine
   <LI> Viewing, printing, exporting, replying, and bouncing of message
	digests was broken. Replying and bouncing should not have been
	allowed at all for digests. It would be nice to have a more standard
	index-like view of a message digest but that has not been addressed
	with this minor bug fix.
   <LI> Adjust wrapping of HTML messages so that the margins specified by
	<A HREF="h_config_viewer_margin_left"><!--#echo var="VAR_viewer-margin-left"--></A> and
	<A HREF="h_config_viewer_margin_right"><!--#echo var="VAR_viewer-margin-right"--></A>

   <LI> The <A HREF="h_config_unk_char_set"><!--#echo var="VAR_unknown-character-set"--></A>
	option did not work correctly interpreting unknown characters in message headers
   <LI> Long address lines could cause blank continuation lines
   <LI> Save to a local default INBOX failed if the primary collection was also local,
	which it is by default. The save went to  ~/mail/inbox instead.
   <LI> Make a default save folder of &quot;inbox&quot; always mean the real
	inbox, not the inbox in the primary collection
   <LI> Address book entries with lots of addresses would be truncated when
	entered in the composer with a screen size wider than 270 or so charcters
   <LI> Some fields in the index screen were truncated when the screen width was
	wider than 256 characters
   <LI> Crash when TABing to next folder, the next folder with new mail is a POP
	folder, and there is a more than 10 minute pause between typing the TAB

<P>
Version 1.10(962)
addressed bugs found in previous releases and had a few additions as well.
<P>
Additions included:
<P>

<UL>
   <LI> Add the possibility of setting a default role
	(see <A HREF="h_role_select">Roles Screen</A>)
	which may be convenient if your work flow involves acting in one
	role for a while then switching to another role and staying in the
	new role for another period of time
   <LI> When Saving and the IMAP server problem &quot;Message to save shrank!&quot;
	is encountered, ask the user if he or she wants to continue with the
	risky Save anyway instead of aborting. This may be helpful if your
	IMAP server is broken in this way but be aware that it is possible there
	was a real error instead of just a broken server implementation.
   <LI> Some configure adjustments for Kerberos detection and
	for SCO OpenServer 5 support
   <LI> Hide INBOX in a collection if it also appears as an
	<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">Incoming Folder</A>
   <LI> Show asterisks for feedback when the user is typing a password
   <LI> Performance improvement for threading of large folders
   <LI> Previously, the search used to find
	Pattern matches containing To patterns searched for both To
	and Resent-To headers. The relatively complicated search this
	produces causes problems when using some deficient IMAP servers.
	Now the default is to look only for To headers and ignore the
	presence of Resent-To. The previous behavior may be restored
	with the <A HREF="h_config_use_resentto"><!--#echo var="FEAT_use-resent-to-in-rules"--></A> feature.
   <LI> Add an
	<A HREF="h_config_unk_char_set"><!--#echo var="VAR_unknown-character-set"--></A>
	to help with reading malformed unlabeled messages
   <LI><A HREF="h_config_suppress_user_agent"><!--#echo var="FEAT_suppress-user-agent-when-sending"--></A> option added
   <LI> Map some Shift-LeftArrow escape sequences to LeftArrow
   <LI> Add feature <A HREF="h_config_warn_if_fcc_blank"><!--#echo var="FEAT_warn-if-blank-fcc"--></A>
</UL>

<P>
Bugs addressed in the 1.10(962) release included:
<P>

<UL>

   <LI> Crash in composer caused by overflow in replace_pat()
   <LI> Hang when authenticating to an SMTP server that fails with a
	&quot;connection disconnected&quot; error
   <LI> Bug in handling of trailing tab character in flowed text
   <LI> Security enhancement for mailcap parameter substitution
   <LI> <A HREF="h_config_strip_sigdashes"><!--#echo var="FEAT_strip-from-sigdashes-on-reply"--></A>

   <LI> Don't allow printer to be changed through hidden config screen
	if system administrator didn't want it to be allowed
   <LI> Attempts are sometimes made to set the Forwarded flag when alpine
	should know that it won't work, causing error messages to appear
   <LI> A <A HREF="h_config_reply_indent_string"><!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"--></A>
        of double-quote double-quote didn't work right
   <LI> Quoting wasn't being done to protect special characters from the
	MacOS X shell when
	<A HREF="h_config_browser"><!--#echo var="VAR_url-viewers"--></A>
	was not defined
   <LI> On MacOS X message attachments should be shown internally instead of
	being shown using the Mail application
   <LI> When replying to a message with a charset of X-UNKNOWN Alpine would
	sometimes set the outgoing charset to X-UNKNOWN, making the result
	unreadable
   <LI> When the sending of a message failed lines with leading spaces had one
	additional space inserted in each of those lines when the user
	was returned to the composer
   <LI> The <A HREF="h_index_cmd_whereis">WhereIs</A> command missed some index lines
	that contained non-ascii characters because it was truncating the
	line being searched so that it was shorter than what was visible on
	the screen
   <LI> When composing, an attachment with a long name that causes wrapping in
	just the wrong place would generate an error and cause the send
	of the attachment to fail
   <LI> After calling the file browser to attach a file in the composer, a resize
	of the window when back in the composer would redraw the last screen that
	had been shown in the browser instead of the current composer screen
   <LI> Possible crash in index screen when encountering unparseable addresses
	or when using one of the PRIORITY tokens or the HEADER token in the
	<a href="h_config_index_format"><!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--></a>
   <LI> Problems with Header Color editing if the configuration option

	was inadvertently changed to the Empty Value in the hidden config screen
   <LI> When resuming the final postponed message from an Exchange server the user
	could get a certificate validation failure because alpine was trying
	to validate the canonical name of the folder instead of the name the
	user used
   <LI> Windows line endings in a mimetypes file on a Unix system cause a
	failure to find a match
   <LI> Make matching of extension names case independent in mimetypes files
   <LI> Windows dialog boxes for entering text were not working correctly
   <LI> Replying to or Forwarding multipart/alternative messages which had a
	single text/html part did not work well
   <LI> Printing the print confirmation page caused a crash
   <LI> A To line with a long, quoted personal name could display incorrectly

Version 1.00
was an evolutionary release based on
<A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">Pine</A>, which was also
developed at the University of Washington.
It is upwards-compatible for existing Pine users.

<P>
Changes included:
<P>
<UL>
   <LI> Ground-up reorganization of source code around addition
	of "pith/" core routine library.
   <LI> Fundamental improvement in Alpine's internal text handling, which
	is now based exclusively on Unicode. This allows displaying incoming
	messages and producing outgoing messages in many different languages.
   <LI> Ground-up reorganization of build and install procedures
	based on GNU Build System's autotools. NOTE, the included IMAP library
	build is not based on autotools, so some features will not work. However,
	it should get built automatically during the Alpine build process.
   <LI> Web-based version included built on TCL designed to run under
	a suitable CGI-supporting web server such as Apache.

<P><A NAME="content">Unix Alpine Only.</A>

<P> If your version of Alpine has been built with password file support
then you can use a special file to save your passwords, and avoid typing
them every time you open a connection to a remote server.

<P> If, in addition, your version of Alpine was built with SMIME support, then your 
password file will be encrypted with a strong key. There are two ways in 
which this can happen: Alpine will either use a matching private key and 
public certificate pair that you already own, or it will create one for 
you, just for purposes of encrypting this file. We describe both processes 
below.

<P> Initially, Alpine will scan your public and private directories for a 
certificate/private key pair that works. Alpine will pick the first pair 
that it finds that matches. 

<P> Once a pair has been chosen, it will be copied to the directory 
~/.alpine-smime/.pwd, and from then on, Alpine will use the pair found in 
that directory. The first time this process is done, this directory will 
be created, a key/certificate pair will be copied to it, from then on 
this pair will be used to encrypt and decrypt your password file. 

<P> If you want to use a specific key and certificate pair to encrypt
your password file, you can create the directory ~/.alpine-smime/.pwd 
manually, and then create your preferred key/certificate pair there.
Alpine will use this key regardless of if it has expired, or if it is
self-signed. These issues do not affect the encryption or decryption
of the password file.

<P> If you prefer not to use the directory ~/.alpine-smime/.pwd to save 
your key/certificate pair, you can specify a different one with the 
-pwdcertdir command line option in Alpine. If the directory specified by 
this option is not found Alpine will fail to encrypt and decrypt your 
password file. However if it exists, Alpine will search for a 
key/certificate pair in that
directory, and if it does not find one, it will create one and save it
in that directory.

<P> Alpine does not care about the names of the key and certificates in 
this directory, but the private key must have &quot;.key&quot; extension 
and your public certificate must have the &quot;.crt&quot; extension. The
name of the private key will be used in the prompt when you are asked
to unlock your key to decrypt your password.

<P> If Alpine cannot find a suitable private key and public certificate 
pair to encrypt your password, it will create one. You will be asked to 
create a &quot;Master Password&quot; to protect such key. At this moment 
there are no restrictions on passwords, other than they have to be at 
least 8 characters long, but future versions of Alpine will include 
functionality to restrict master passwords, as set up by the administrator 
of the system in the pine.conf.fixed file.

<P><A NAME="example_existing_key"><B>Example of Use of Existing Key and Certificate</B></A>

<P>Assume you have a private key called peter@address.com.key in your, 
~/.alpine-smime/private directory, and a public certificate called 
peter@address.com.crt in your ~/.alpine-smime/public directory, and these 
are your only key/certificate pair.

<P> When Alpine starts for the first time, without command line options, 
it will check if the directory ~/.alpine-smime/.pwd exists, and if not, 
it will create it. Then it will go through your keys and certificates and 
find a pair that it can use, and copy the files peter@address.com.key,
and peter@address.com.crt to the ~/.alpine-smime/.pwd directory. Alternatively
you can do the same by copying these files by yourself. This can be done
with the sequence of commands

<PRE>
mkdir ~/.alpine-smime/.pwd
cp ~/.alpine-smime/private/peter@address.com.key ~/.alpine-smime/.pwd
cp ~/.alpine-smime/public/peter@address.com.crt ~/.alpine-smime/.pwd
</PRE>

<P> When Alpine starts, you will be asked the password to unlock your
private key with the prompt.

<PRE>
Enter password of key &lt;peter@address.com&gt; to unlock password file:
</PRE>

<P> If you prefer to use different names for your private and public keys 
in the ~/.alpine-smime/.pwd directory, you can do so, but you must 
preserve the extension of the files. For example, you can use the names 
private_key.key and public_cert.crt instead. In this case, the prompt you 
will see when you are asked to unlock your private key will read

<PRE>
Enter password of key &lt;private_key&gt; to unlock password file:
</PRE>

<P>Observe that you do not need to use an existing key/certificate pair, 
and that you can create a new private key/public certificate pair to 
encrypt and decrypt your password file. Alpine provides a mechanism to
change the encryption key for this file in the S/MIME configuration
screen.

<P><A NAME="example_self_signed"><B>Example of Creating Master Password</B></A>

<P> If Alpine cannot find a suitable private key and public certificate pair
to encrypt your password file, it will create one. When doing so, it will
start the process with the following warning:

<PRE>
Creating a Master Password for your Password file.
</PRE>

<P> Then Alpine will ask you to enter your Master Password:

<PRE>
Create master password (attempt 1 of 3):
</PRE>

<P> Once you enter this password, and it validates according to system policy,
you will be asked to confirm this password. 

<PRE>
Confirm master password (attempt 1 of 3):
</PRE>

<P> If you input the same password, then Alpine will set that as your 
Master Password, and you will use this password to unlock your key in the 
future.

<P> If you would like to switch your Master Password in the future, you can 
do so by creating a new public key and public certificate pair. You can do 
so in the S/MIME configuration screen, in the &quot;Manage Key and 
Certificate for Password File&quot; section, simply enter your current 
password to unlock your current key and then press &quot;C&quot; to create 
a new key.

<H1>Network Encryption Security Explained</H1>

You can specify which encryption protocol you would like to try when
creating a secure connection to a server. Alpine will attempt to use
that encryption protocol, but in practice the protocol being used will
default to the most secure protocol that both Alpine and the server
support.

<P> If you use the latest version of OpenSSL, the /ssl modifier to the 
server definition will use the most secure version of the TLS encryption 
protocol. The same will be true if you try /tls1_1 or /tls1_2, but in an 
old version of OpenSSL (pre 1.1.0 series) /tls1_1 might mean to use 
version 1.1 of the TLS protocol.

<P> You will never go wrong by using the /ssl modifier. At the time of
this writing OpenSSL had released version 1.1.1, with support for
TLS version 1.3. If your version of OpenSSL does not support this version
of the TLS protocol, then the /tls1_3 modifier will only mean to use
the most secure version of the TLS protocol that OpenSSL and the
server can negotiate. In future versions of OpenSSL, /tls1_3 might mean
to try to negotiate a higher version of the TLS protocol.

<P> In order to avoid confusion, the /ssl flag is the best way to guarantee
the highest encryption protocol available, and it is the recommended
modifier to the server definition to create a secure encrypted connection.

<TITLE>XOAUTH2 Authenticator Explained</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>XOAUTH2 Authenticator Explained</H1>

The XOAUTH2 authenticator method is a way in which you can sign in to your
account to read and send email. This method is different from the traditional
username/password that users are accostumed to, and it needs to be set up
by the user. This text will help you understand this authentication method.

<P>
The most important difference between this method and other autentication
methods is what happens if someone steals your credentials. This method is
attached to three components: Your username, your password and your email
program.

<P>
At the beginning of this process, the developer of the email program 
registers the email program with the email service provider (Gmail, 
Outlook, etc.) In return, the email service provider creates an id and
secret for the email program, which the email program will use in the 
future. Since Alpine is an open source program, these values are part
of the source code, and are known to everyone, and cannot be obfuscated.

<P>
After a program has been registered with an email service provider, the 
user must authorize the email program access to their email account in 
that service. Alpine helps you do that, but it cannot do all the process 
for you, and you will need to use an external web browser to authorize
Alpine to read and send email.

<P>
This part of the process is simple. Alpine creates a URL based on the id 
and secret created by the email service, which the user opens. Once the 
URL has been opened, the user signs in to the server, and once signed into
the account, the user is asked to authorize Alpine access to the email 
account. If the user agrees, an &quot;<I>Access Code</I>&quot; will be
generated.

<P>
An Access Code is a very long string, and so the recommendation is to copy 
and paste this code back into Alpine, at the time Alpine is helping you 
set up this authenticator. This part of the process is done only once per 
email program (If you run Alpine in several computers, you would do this 
once per computer. Each computer gets its own Access Code.)

<P>
Once Alpine has an Access Code, it goes back internally to the email 
service and asks it to generate two strings, called the &quot;<I>Refresh 
Token</I>&quot; and the &quot;<I>Access Token</I>&quot;. This part is 
invisible to the user, and they will never see it, but in order for you to 
understand what to do in case you lose them, you need to understand their 
use.

<P>
The <I>Access Token</I> is the equivalent of a temporary password. It 
allows the user to access (and reaccess as many times as they would like)
their email account for a limited amount of time, typically 1 hour after
it was issued. After that time expires, users need a new Access Token.

<P>
The <I>Refresh Token</I> is the equivalent of a password generator. With 
this token, Alpine can go to the email service provider and request a new 
Access Token. This part of the process does not need user intervention, 
anyone can do this, as long as they have the Refresh Token, program id and 
program secret, so it is important that users keep their Refresh Token as 
secure as they can.

<P>
Given that the Refresh Token and the Access Token are long strings, users 
are not supposed to be able to memorize them and recall them later. Alpine 
will store them in the password file, should a user have one. Otherwise, 
the user will have to create one each time they run Alpine, starting by 
creating the Access Code all over each time they try to sign in to their 
email account. When Alpine is compiled with SSL and password file support, 
it will default to saving this information using encryption and under a 
master password, so unless they have made changes to this process, their 
Refresh and Access Tokens are saved securely and persist from one session 
to the next.

<P>
Should any person steal your Refresh Token, you must login to your account 
with your username and password and revoke Alpine authorization to your 
account. This is enough to stop the person who stole your Refresh Token 
from accessing your email service. In the case of Gmail, changing your 
password will invalidate your Refresh Token, and this will be enough to 
prevent others from using a stolen Refresh Token. Consult with your email
service provider to learn what you can do if someone steals your Refresh
Token.

<P>
If, for any reason, Alpine cannot sign in to your email service for two 
consecutive times with Access Codes generated by your Refresh Token, it 
will remove the Refresh Token from your password file, forcing you to get 
a new one, by getting an Access Code first, and granting authorization to
Alpine to access your email once again.

<P>
This implementation of XOAUTH2 knows the list of servers that it can 
access using the same credentials, so Alpine will be able to read and send 
emails using the same Access Token. You will not have to create 
Access and Refresh Tokens for the IMAP and SMTP servers separately.

<H1>TLS and SSL Certificate Validation Failures</H1>

An attempt was made to establish a secure, encrypted connection to the
server system using either Transport Layer Security (TLS) or the older
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

<P>
An important part of this procedure is server certificate validation.  A
server certificate is an &quot;electronic identification card&quot; for the server
system that is signed by a well-known certificate authority (CA).  Alpine
compares the server system identity in the server certificate with the
name of the server system to which it is trying to connect.  Alpine also
verifies that the CA signature is authentic.

<P>
Some common failure conditions are:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI> [UNIX Alpine] Self signed certificate.  This means that the server system
signed its own certificate.  This does not necessarily indicate anything
bad; the server operators may simply have elected to not purchase a
signed certificate from a certificate authority.

  <LI> [UNIX Alpine] Unable to get local issuer certificate.  This means that
the signature on the server system is from an unknown certificate authority.
It can also mean that no certificate authority certificates have been
installed on the local UNIX system.

  <LI> [PC Alpine] Self-signed certificate or untrusted authority.  This is
the same as either of the above two conditions in UNIX Alpine.  Note that
Windows systems typically have a full set of certificate authority
certificates installed, so it is more likely to be a self-signed
certificate than an unknown certificate authority.

  <LI> Server name does not match certificate.  This means that the server
presented a proper signed certificate for a name other than the desired
name.
</UL>

<P>
Any of these conditions can indicate that you are being attacked and have
been directed to an imposter server that will record your password and
your private mail messages.  It can also mean something innocuous.

<P>
If you are certain that the problem is innocuous, you can append the
option

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/novalidate-cert</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

to the server system name where it appears in your configuration (e.g. the
<A HREF="h_config_inbox_path"><!--#echo var="VAR_inbox-path"--></A>,
a folder-collection, or a news or SMTP server).  This will
disable certificate validation.  On the other hand, if you are attacked,
you will get no warning if you do this.

<P> When you get a error indicating a self-signed certficate from the 
remote server, you can download and install the certificate for that 
server. Avoid using the /NoValidate-Cert modifier. Alpine cannot help you 
with this process because certificates are part of the system and are not 
under the control of the user. Find directions on how to download and 
install certificates for your system using your favorite search engine.

<P><CENTER><SAMP>$$text</SAMP></CENTER><P>

is the value of a configuration option, it will be expanded to

<P><CENTER><SAMP>$text</SAMP></CENTER><P>

and no environment lookup will be done.
For Unix Alpine it will also work to use a backslash character to
escape the special meaning of the dollar sign, but $$ is preferable since
it works for both PC-Alpine and Unix Alpine, allowing the configuration option
to be in a shared configuration file.
<P>

This all sounds more complicated than it actually is.
An example may make it clearer.
Unfortunately, the way in which environment variables are set is OS-dependent 
and command shell-dependent.
In some Unix command shells you may use

<P><CENTER><SAMP>PERSNAME="Fred Flintstone"</SAMP></CENTER><P>
   <CENTER><SAMP>export PERSNAME</SAMP></CENTER><P>

Now, if you use Alpine's Setup/Config screen to set

<P><CENTER><SAMP><!--#echo var="VAR_personal-name"-->=$PERSNAME</SAMP></CENTER><P>

the <SAMP>$PERSNAME</SAMP> would be replaced by <SAMP>Fred Flintstone</SAMP>
so that this would be equivalent to

<P><CENTER><SAMP><!--#echo var="VAR_personal-name"-->=Fred Flintstone</SAMP></CENTER><P>

Note, environment variable substitution happens after configuration
options that are lists are split into the separate elements of the list,
so a single environment variable can't contain a list of values.

<P>
The environment variable doesn't have to be the only thing
after the equal sign.
However, if the name of the variable is not at the end of the line or
followed by a space (so that you can tell where the variable name ends),
it must be enclosed in curly braces like

<P><CENTER><SAMP>${VAR}</SAMP></CENTER><P>

It is always ok to use the braces even if you don't need to.
<P>
It is also possible to set a default value for an environment variable.
This default value will be used if the environment variable is not
set (that is, if getenv(&quot;VAR&quot;) returns NULL).
The syntax used to set a default value is

<P><CENTER><SAMP>${VAR:-default value}</SAMP></CENTER><P>

If the config file contains

<P><CENTER><SAMP>personal-name=${VAR:-Fred Flintstone}</SAMP></CENTER><P>

then when Alpine is run <SAMP>VAR</SAMP> will be looked up in the environment.
If <SAMP>VAR</SAMP> is found then <SAMP>personal-name</SAMP> will have
the value that <SAMP>VAR</SAMP> was set to, otherwise,
<SAMP>personal-name</SAMP> will be set to <SAMP>Fred Flintstone</SAMP>,
the default value.
(Note that the variable is called &quot;personal-name&quot; in the config
file but is displayed in the config screen as
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_personal-name"-->&quot;.
In general, the value that goes into a config file is never exactly the
same as the value you see on the screen.)

<P>
An example where an environment variable might be useful is the
variable <SAMP>Inbox-Path</SAMP> in the global configuration file.
Suppose most users used the server

<P><CENTER><SAMP>imapserver.example.com</SAMP></CENTER><P>

but that there were some exceptions who used

<P><CENTER><SAMP>altimapserver.example.com</SAMP></CENTER><P>

In this case, the system manager might include the following line in
the systemwide default Alpine configuration file

<P><CENTER><SAMP>Inbox-Path=${IMAPSERVER:-imapserver.example.com}</SAMP></CENTER><P>

For the exceptional users adding

<P><CENTER><SAMP>IMAPSERVER=altimapserver.example.com</SAMP></CENTER><P>

to their environment should work.
<P>
Another example might be the case where a user has to use a different
SMTP server from work and from home.
The setup might be something as simple as

<P><CENTER><SAMP>smtp-server=$SMTP</SAMP></CENTER><P>

or perhaps a default value could be given.
Note that, as mentioned above, the variable <SAMP>SMTP</SAMP> cannot contain
a list of SMTP servers.
<P>

<H2>Configuration precedence</H2>

There are several levels of Alpine configuration.  Configuration values at
a given level override corresponding values at lower levels.  In order of
increasing precedence:
<P>
<UL>
 <LI> built-in defaults
 <LI> system-wide
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
      config file from command line or provided
      by "PINECONF" environment variable
<!--chtml else-->
      pine.conf file
<!--chtml endif-->
 <LI> personal configuration file
 <LI> personal exceptions configuration file
 <LI> command-line options
 <!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"--><!--chtml else-->
 <LI> system-wide pine.conf.fixed file<!--chtml endif-->
</UL>
<P>
The values in both the personal configuration file and the
<A HREF="h_config_exceptions">exceptions</A>
configuration file may be set using the Setup command.
Setup/Config is the command to change most of the personal configuration
options.
The other Setup subcommands are also used to change the configuration,
for example, Setup/AddressBook, Setup/Rules, and so on.
Changing the personal exceptions configuration is very similar.
To change a value in the Config screen you would use the command
Setup/eXceptions/Config.
Likewise for the other Setup subcommands (Setup/eXceptions/Rules and so on).
<P>
There are a couple exceptions to the rule that configuration values are replaced
by the value of the same option in a higher-precedence file.
The Feature-List variable has values that are additive, but can be
negated by prepending &quot;no-&quot; in front of an individual feature name.
So for features, each individual feature's value is replaced by the value
of the same feature in a higher-precedence file.
Note that this is done automatically for you when you change these values via
the Setup/Config command.
The other exception to the <EM>replace</EM> semantics happens when you
use <A HREF="h_config_inheritance">configuration inheritance</A>
for option lists.
<P>

<H2>File name defaults</H2>

Notes:<P>

<BR> &lt;exe dir&gt; = directory where pine.exe found.
<BR> &lt;pinerc dir&gt; = directory where pinerc found.
<BR> # = default file name is overridable in pinerc.
<BR> $HOME, if not explicitly set, defaults to root of the current drive.
<BR> $MAILCAPS, if set, is used in lieu of the default mailcap search paths.
<BR> + between the mailcap paths implies that the two files are combined.
<BR> ; between other default paths implies that the first one found is used.
</P>
Alpine looks for most support files in the same directory it finds its
personal configuration file (pinerc).  The -p command-line flag may be
used to specify a particular path name for the pinerc file.  If a
pinerc file does not exist, it will be created (if directory permissions
allow).  In PC-Alpine, if -p or $PINERC are not defined, Alpine will look
in $HOME&#92;PINE and the directory containing the PINE.EXE.  If a PINERC
file does not exist in either one, it will create one in the first of those
two directories that is writable.  In detail:

</PRE>
<P>

<H2>Mailcap files</H2>

Alpine honors the mailcap configuration system for specifying external
programs for handling attachments.  The mailcap file maps MIME attachment
types to the external programs loaded on your system that can display
and/or print the file.  A sample mailcap file comes bundled with the Alpine
distribution.  It includes comments that explain the syntax you need to
use for mailcap.  With the mailcap file, any program (mail readers,
newsreaders, WWW clients) can use the same configuration for handling
MIME-encoded data.
<P>

<H2>MIME-Types files</H2>

Alpine uses mime-types files (.mime.types or MIMETYPE) to determine
what Content-Type to use for labeling an attached file, based on
the file extension.  That is, this file provides a mapping between
filename extensions and MIME content-types.
<P>

<H2>Environment variables</H2>

PC-Alpine uses the following environment variables:
<DL>
<DT>PINERC</DT>
<DD>Optional path to pinerc file.</DD>
<DT>PINERCEX</DT>
<DD>Optional path to personal exceptions configuration file.</DD>
<DT>PINECONF</DT>
<DD>Optional path to global pine config file.</DD>
<DT>HOME</DT>
<DT>TMPDIR, TMP, or TEMP</DT>
<DT>COMSPEC</DT>
<DT>MAILCAPS</DT>
<DD>A <B>semicolon</B> delimited list of path names to mailcap files.</DD>
<DT>USER_DICTIONARY</DT>
<DD>Used to specify the file to contain the user's spell check
dictionary.  The default is <SAMP>DICT.U</SAMP> in the same
directory as the <SAMP>SPELL32.DLL</SAMP></DD>
</DL>

Unix Alpine uses the following environment variables:
<DL>
<DT>TERM</DT>
<DD>Tells Alpine what kind of terminal is being used.</DD>
<DT>DISPLAY</DT>
<DD>Determines if Alpine will try to display IMAGE attachments.</DD>
<DT>SHELL</DT>
<DD>If not set, default is &quot;/bin/sh&quot;.</DD>
<DT>TMPDIR, TMP, or TEMP</DT>

<H2>Common PC-Alpine Configuration Problems</H2>

<H3>Configuration settings aren't being saved</H3>

<P>This problem can happen if you run pine from one directory and
then decide to move your pine directory to another location.  PC-Alpine
stores certain variables, including the configuration location, in the
Windows Registry (which you shouldn't ever need to manually edit).  There
are a couple of ways to go about removing or resetting the values in the
registry.

<P>
1) Run PC-Alpine's registry value deletion command.  This can be done by
running: &quot;&lt;your&nbsp;pine&nbsp;directory&gt;&#92;pine.exe&nbsp;-registry&nbsp;clear&quot; from the DOS
prompt. You could create a shortcut to pine.exe and change the &quot;Target&quot;
value to the above command.

<P>
2) Tell PC-Alpine where to look for the configuration file.  Configuration
information is stored in a file called the PINERC.  With the &quot;-p&nbsp;PINERC&quot;
option, you can tell PC-Alpine the location of your pinerc.  An example of
this would be to run: &quot;&lt;your&nbsp;pine&nbsp;directory&gt;&#92;pine.exe&nbsp;-p&nbsp;C:&#92;pine&#92;mypinerc&quot;.
Again, you can use the DOS prompt or the shortcut method explained in (1).

<P>
Additionally, there is the &quot;-registry&nbsp;set&quot; option, which will actively
set registry values to the current setting, and is therefore useful with
the &quot;-p&nbsp;PINERC&quot; option.

<TITLE>Information on mbox driver</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Information on &quot;Missing Mail&quot; and the &quot;mbox&quot; driver</H1>

Beginning with Pine 4.00 (Pine came before Alpine)
a new INBOX access method is
available as part of the standard configuration.  It is called the
&quot;mbox&quot; driver and it works like this:<P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the file &quot;mbox&quot; exists in the user's home directory, and
is in Unix mailbox format, then when INBOX is opened this file will be
selected as INBOX instead of the mail spool file.  Messages will be
automatically transferred from the mail spool file into the mbox
file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The advantage of this method is that, after new mail has been copied
from the system mail spool, all subsequent access is confined to the
user's home directory, which is desirable on some systems.  However, a
possible disadvantage is that mail tools other than those from the
University of Washington will not know to look for mail in the user's
mbox file.  For example, POP or IMAP servers other than those from the
University of Washington, and many &quot;new mail notification&quot;
programs may not work as expected with this driver enabled.<P>

To disable this behavior, either remove/rename the &quot;mbox&quot;
file or find the <A HREF="h_config_disable_drivers"><!--#echo var="VAR_disable-these-drivers"--></A>
option in Setup/Config
and add &quot;mbox&quot; to it:

<TITLE>FAQs on Alpine Locking</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>What Systems Managers Need to Know about Alpine File Locking</H1>

There is an extensive section on locking in the Alpine technical notes;
this information is intended to provide answers to some common questions:<P>
<OL>
<LI> Why did locking change in Pine 4.00?<BR>
The actual locking mechanisms did not change in 4.00.
What changed is that when one particular locking mechanism used by Alpine 
fails, Alpine now issues a warning message.  Prior to Pine 4.00, the locking
failure would occur, but no warning was issued.<P>

<LI> Is this what the &quot;Mailbox vulnerable&quot; message is about?<BR>
Yes.  It means that Alpine was unable to create a lockfile in the
spool directory, generally because of overly restrictive protections on the
spool directory.  The correct permissions on the spool directory for
running Alpine are 1777, i.e. read-write-execute permission for everyone,
with the sticky-bit set, so only owners of a file can delete them.<P>

<LI> Why does Alpine require that the mail spool directory have 1777
   protections?<BR>
Alpine was designed to run without special privileges.  This means that in
order to create a lockfile in the spool directory, it is necessary to have
the spool directory permissions be world-writable.<P>

<LI> Can't you create the lockfile somewhere else?<BR>
No.  The lockfile in question must be in the mail spool directory, because
that's where the mail delivery program expects to find it, and the purpose
of the file is to coordinate access between the mail client (Alpine) and the
mail delivery program.<P>

<LI> Isn't having the spool directory world-writable a big security risk?<BR>
No.  Remember that the individual mail files in the spool directory are
NOT world-writable, only the containing directory.  Setting the &quot;sticky
bit&quot; -- indicated by the &quot;1&quot; before the &quot;777&quot; mode 
-- means that only the owner of the file (or root) can delete files in the 
directory.  So the only bad behavior that is invited by the 1777 mode is that 
anyone could
create a random file in the spool directory.  If the spool directory is
under quota control along with home directories, there is little incentive
for anyone to do this, and even without quotas a periodic scan for
non-mail files usually takes care of the problem.  <P>

<LI> Why not run Alpine as setgid mail?<BR>
Alpine was never designed to run with privileges, and to do so introduces a
significant security vulnerability.  For example, if a user suspends Alpine,
the resulting shell will have group privileges.  This is one example of
why we strongly recommend against running Alpine as a privileged program.
In addition, a &quot;privileged mailer &quot paradigm would mean that normal 
users
could not test Alpine versions or other mailers that had not been installed
by the system administrators.<P>


<LI> Are there any alternatives to creating .lock files in the spool dir?<BR>
There are, but they all have different sets of tradeoffs, and not all will
work on all systems.  Some examples:<UL>
 <LI> Use lock system calls.  Works fine on a few systems, provided mail
   spool is local.   Doesn't work reliably if NFS is used.
   Doesn't work unless <B>all</B> the mail programs accessing the spool dir
   use the same calls.
 <LI> Deliver mail to user's home directory.  An excellent solution, highly
   recommended -- but one which is incompatible with some &quot;legacy&quot; 
mail tools that always look in the spool directory for the mail.
</UL><P>

<LI> Are these spool directory lock files the only kinds of locks used by
   Alpine?<BR>
No.  Alpine also creates lockfiles in the /tmp directory.  For normal Unix
mailbox format folders, these are used to coordinate access between
multiple Alpine sessions.  <P>

<LI> What about the 
<A HREF="h_config_quell_lock_failure_warnings">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-lock-failure-warnings"-->&quot;</A> feature added in Pine 4.01?<BR>
This is for people who are content to live dangerously, or who have
specific knowledge that the spool directory lockfiles are superfluous on
their system (because both Alpine and the mail delivery program are using 
system call file locking in a context that works reliably, e.g. not NFS.)<P>

<LI> Where can I find more details on how Alpine locking works?<BR>
See the Alpine Technical Notes.<P>

When you are viewing a help screen, there may be links to
other topics highlighted (in Reverse video) in the text.
Here is an example.
The word &quot;Introduction&quot; in the TABLE OF CONTENTS below should be
highlighted.
If you type carriage return (or V for View Link, see the commands at the
bottom of the screen) you will be taken to a new help screen to view the
Introduction.
The commands at the bottom of the screen should then include
&quot;P Prev Help&quot;.
If you type &quot;P&quot; you will end up back here.
If you type &quot;E&quot; for Exit, you will be back out of help and returned
to the place you were in Alpine when you entered Help.
In this case, you would go back to the MAIN MENU.
There are also other links that are highlighted in bold (or the color used
by your terminal to display bold).
The items after the Introduction in the TABLE OF CONTENTS are all examples
of such links.
In order to view those links, you first have to make the link you want
to view the current link.
The &quot;NextLink&quot; and &quot;PrevLink&quot; commands
(see bottom of screen) can do that for you.

<BODY>
<H1>Introduction</H1>

Alpine is an &quot;Alternatively Licensed Program for Internet
News and Email&quot; produced until 2009 by the University of Washington.
It is intended to be an easy-to-use program for
sending, receiving, and filing Internet electronic mail messages and
bulletin board (Netnews/Usenet) messages. Alpine supports the following
Internet protocols and specifications: SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol), 
NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol), MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail 
Extensions), IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), and LDAP (Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol).<p>

Although originally designed for inexperienced email users, Alpine has
evolved to support many advanced features.  There are an ever-growing
number of configuration and personal-preference options, though which of
them are available to you is determined by your local system managers. 

<H2>WHAT ALPINE DOES...</H2>

Alpine is a &quot;mail user agent&quot; (MUA), which is a program that
allows you to
compose and read messages using Internet mail standards.  (Whether you
can correspond with others on the Internet depends on whether or not your
computer is connected to the Internet.)  Alpine also allows reading and
posting messages on the Internet &quot;net news&quot; system, provided
that your site operates a suitable news server.

<H2>WHAT ALPINE DOES NOT DO...</H2>

A &quot;mail user agent&quot; such as Alpine is just one part of a
messaging system. Here are some things that are <B>not</B> done by Alpine,
but require other programs:<P>
<UL>
 <LI> Actual relaying of email... which is done by &quot;message transfer 
agents&quot;.
 <LI> Vacation messages... automatically responding to incoming messages
 <LI> Anything to do with &quot;talk&quot;... which has nothing to do with 
email.
 <LI> Anything to do with &quot;irc&quot;... which has nothing to do with email.
 <LI> List processing... resending one message to a list of recipients.

<H1>Alpine Help</H1>

Alpine help is generally context-sensitive. In other words, each Alpine screen you 
use will have its own help text, explaining the choices available for that
screen. This general help section, on the other hand, attempts to give an 
overall picture of what Alpine is capable of doing, as well as pointers to 
additional help sections about specific topics.<p>

Much of the help text contains links to further help topics, similar to
how the World Wide Web works.
You may choose a link to view using the &quot;NextLink&quot; and
&quot;PrevLink&quot; commands to change the link that is highlighted.
The &quot;View Link&quot; command will then show you the highlighted link.
Similar to the Back button in a web browser, the &quot;Prev Help&quot; command
will return you to where you were before viewing the link, and &quot;Exit Help&quot
will return you to the location in Alpine before you asked for help.
For example, if you are reading this text in Alpine you may return to the
help table of contents with the &quot;Prev Help&quot; command or you may view the
Release notes link in the next paragraph and then return here with
&quot;Prev Help&quot;.
<P>

In addition to this general help on Alpine, <A HREF="h_news">Release Notes</A>
on the current Alpine version are also available from the MAIN MENU: Press
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
&quot;F9&quot;
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;R&quot;
<!--chtml endif-->
to browse the release notes.  These include changes since the last release,
configuration information, the history of the Alpine
project, credits, and legal notices.

<BODY>
<H1>Giving Commands in Alpine</H1>

Unless configured otherwise
(<A HREF="h_config_blank_keymenu"><!--#echo var="FEAT_disable-keymenu"--></A>)
the bottom two lines of the screen are always used to list the
commands you can give.  You press the keys that are highlighted to give
the command.  The commands for getting help and going back to the main
menu are always present (except when viewing help as you are now).
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
<!--chtml else-->
<p>
Pressing O (meaning &quot;Other Commands&quot;) changes the keys
you see at the bottom of any screen. In some cases there are 3 or
even 4 different
sets of keys that can be seen by using the O key. <EM>All commands are 
active</EM>, even if they are not currently showing at the bottom of your 
screen. In other words, you <EM>never</EM> need to press the O key, except to 
remind yourself of the proper key to press to perform an operation.

<H2>Control Key Commands</H2>
When composing mail, and in a few other places, in Alpine you
have to use Control keys. This means pressing the Control key (usually labeled 
&quot;Ctrl&quot;) and the
letter indicated at the same time.  Usually, this is shown with a
&quot;^&quot; in front of the letter.  On some systems, certain control
characters are intercepted before they get to Alpine.  As a work-around,
you can press the ESCAPE key twice followed by the desired key.  For
example, if Ctrl-O (^O) does not work on your system, try typing
&quot;ESC ESC O&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
<H2>Paging Up and Down</H2>
The &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; keys are used for
moving to the next or previous page.  The space bar is a synonym for
&quot;+&quot;.  You may also use Ctrl-V to page down and Ctrl-Y to page
up as you do in the message composer.  On screens with a WhereIs (search)
command, W or Ctrl-W followed by Ctrl-V will move to the bottom of the
message or list, and W or Ctrl-W followed by Ctrl-Y will move to the top
of the message or list.

<H2>Return Key</H2>
The return key is usually a synonym for a frequently used
command.  When viewing a message, there is currently not a default
command, so RETURN does nothing; when in the index, it is synonymous with
&quot;view msg&quot;. In the key menu at the bottom of the screen, whatever is
enclosed in square brackets [] is the same as the return key.

<H2>Control Keys Not Used By Alpine</H2>
Most commands in Alpine are single letters, with -- we hope -- some mnemonic 
value, but in places where Alpine is expecting text input, e.g. in the composer or 
at prompts for file/folder names, control keys must be used for editing and 
navigation functions.
<P>

Alpine has used nearly all the control keys available.  There are, however,
certain control keys that are reserved by other programs or for technical
reasons.  Alpine does not use any of these keys:
<DL>
 <DT>Ctrl-S</DT> <DD>Used by Unix as &quot;stop output&quot;</DD>
 <DT>Ctrl-Q</DT> <DD>Used by Unix as &quot;resume output&quot;</DD>
 <DT>Ctrl-]</DT> <DD>Often used by Telnet as escape key</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Note: Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q can be subject to 
<A HREF="h_special_xon_xoff">special handling</A>.
<P>
In addition, while the ESC key alone is not used for command input,
Alpine will recognize two consecutive ESC key presses followed by a letter 
key as a substitute for control key input.  For example, the control key
<SAMP>Ctrl-X</SAMP> can alternatively be entered using the
three keystrokes: <SAMP>ESC&nbsp;ESC&nbsp;x</SAMP>.
This is useful if the communication program you are using
(e.g. Telnet) has its own, conflicting, idea of what certain control
characters mean.


<H2>Repainting the Screen</H2>
Sometimes what is displayed on the screen will be
incorrect due to noise on the phone line or other causes and you will want
to repaint the whole screen to make it correct.  You can use the Ctrl-L
command to do this.  It never hurts to do it when in doubt.

<BODY>
<H1>Titlebar Line</H1>

The top line of the screen is Alpine's titlebar line.  It will always display
the current version of Alpine and will also convey information about the
status of the program.  This is where you look to find out what
collection, folder and message number is active and where you are in Alpine.
<P>

If the titlebar line says &quot;READONLY&quot; it means that the open folder
(typically your INBOX) is &quot;locked&quot; by another mail session --
most likely a more recent session of Alpine has taken the INBOX lock.
<P>

If the titlebar line says &quot;CLOSED&quot; it means that you are trying to
access a
folder on a remote mail server, and for some reason, communication with
the mail server has either been lost, or never successfully established.
This can be a result of trying to open a non-existent folder, or one
stored on an invalid or non-operational server, or it can mean that Alpine
has been suspended for more that 30 minutes while accessing a remote mail
server.

<H1>Main Menu</H1>

The Main Menu lists Alpine's main options.
The key or keys you must type to enter your
choice are to the left of each option or command name.
You can type either uppercase or lowercase letters,
and you should not press &lt;Return&gt; after typing the
letter (unless you are specifically asking for the default,
highlighted command).
<P>

From the Main Menu you can choose to read online help, write (compose) and 
send a message, look at an index of your mail messages, open or maintain
your mail folders, update your address book, configure Alpine, and quit Alpine.
There are additional options listed at
the bottom of the screen as well.

<P>
The Help command usually returns context-sensitive help information.
However, in the Main Menu you get the most general help, which includes
a Table of Contents.
The last entry in the Table of Contents is an Index of help topics,
so this is a good place to go if you are having trouble finding how
to do something.

<H2>Main Menu Commands</H2>
The Alpine main menu lists the most common Alpine functions. A <a

As you use email, you can build a list of your regular email correspondents 
in your Alpine
Address Book. At the Alpine MAIN MENU, press A to see the Address Book List 
screen. Your
personal address book will be highlighted. Press &lt;Return&gt; to view it.
You can use the address book to store email addresses for individuals or
groups, to create easily
remembered &quot;nicknames&quot; for these addresses, and to quickly retrieve an email 
address when you are composing a message.
<P>
There are two ways to add addresses to your address book: you can add them 
manually or take them from messages (by pressing T to access the Take command). 
With either method, you specify nicknames for your correspondents. A single 
address book entry (or nickname) can point to just one email address, or, it can
point to more than one. When it points to more than one, it is called a 
distribution list. Each distribution list has a nickname, a full name, and a 
list of addresses. These
addresses may be actual addresses, other nicknames in your address book, or 
other
distribution lists.

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a standard means of accessing 
an organization's shared
directories. Essentially, using LDAP, Alpine is able to find email addresses in 
large address
books, rather like the White Pages provided by the phone company. As an Alpine 
user, it is not
necessary to know much about how this works, only how to use it and how to 
configure
it.

In Alpine's message index, the selected message is highlighted. The first 
column on the left is blank, shows a &quot;+&quot; if the message was
sent directly to you (i.e., it is not a
copy or from a list), or a &quot;-&quot; if you were explicitly Cc'd.
<P>
The second column may be blank, or it may contain:
<ul>
  <li>"N" if the message is new (unread), </li>
  <li>"A" if you have answered the message (using the Reply command), </li>
  <li>"D" if you have marked the message for deletion.</li>
</ul>

<P>
Note: If you answer a message as well as mark it deleted (in either order), 
you will only see the &quot;D&quot;.

<P>
The rest of the columns in the message line show you the message
number, date sent, sender, size, and subject. For details, press ? (Help).  
The behavior and appearance of the Index screen is highly configurable.
In the Setup/Config screen search (with the WhereIs command) for options
that contain the words &quot;index&quot; or &quot;thread&quot; to see
many of the configuration possibilities.
In particular, the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_index_format"><!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--></A>&quot;
option may be used to configure the look of the standard MESSAGE INDEX lines
in many different ways.
Find <!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--> in the Setup/Config screen and
read the help text there for more information.
<P>
Most of the commands you need to handle your messages are visible at the
bottom of the screen, and you can press O (OTHER CMDS) to see additional
commands that are available.
You do not need to see these &quot;other commands&quot;
on the screen to use them. That is, you never need to press O as a prefix
for any other command.

<H1>Folders</H1>

Messages can quickly accumulate in your INBOX folder. If you use email
often, you soon could have hundreds. You need to delete messages you do
not want, and you can use folders to organize messages you wish to save. A
folder is a collection of one or more messages that are stored (just like
the messages in your INBOX) so you can access and manage them.

<P>
You can organize your email messages into different folders by topic,
correspondent, date, or any other category that is meaningful to you. You
can create your own folders, and Alpine automatically provides three:
<ul>
  <li>The INBOX folder: messages sent to you are listed in this folder.
      When you first start Alpine and go to the Message Index screen, you are
looking at the list of messages in your INBOX folder. Every incoming
message remains in your INBOX until you delete it or save it in another
folder. </li>
  <li>The sent-mail folder: copies of messages you send are stored in this 
folder. This is
convenient if you cannot remember whether you actually sent a message and want 
to check, or
if you want to send a message again.</li>
  <li>The saved-messages folder: copies of messages you save are stored in this 
folder
unless you choose to save them to other folders you create yourself.</li>

<H1>Color</H1>

If the terminal emulator you are using is capable of displaying color or if
you are using PC-Alpine, then it is possible to set up Alpine so that various
parts of the display will be shown in colors you configure. This is done
using the Setup Color screen, available from the MAIN MENU by selecting
the Setup command followed by &quot;K&quot; for Kolor (because &quot;C&quot;
stands for Config in this context).

<P>
For example, you may color things like the titlebar, the current item,
the keymenu, and the status messages.
You may also color lines in the index, and headers and quoted text in the
MESSAGE TEXT screen.
You use the Color Setup screen for configuring most of this, but you must
use the IndexColor setup for coloring whole index lines.
These are available from the MAIN MENU under Setup/Kolor and Setup/Rules/IndexColor.

<P>

<H1>Using a Mouse</H1>

If you are using PC-Alpine mouse support is turned on automatically.
If you are using UNIX Alpine within an X terminal window or within
a terminal emulator that supports an xterm-style mouse, then you may
turn on support for the mouse with the feature
<A HREF="h_config_enable_mouse"><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-mouse-in-xterm"--></A>.
For UNIX Alpine you will also need to set the $DISPLAY environment variable.
<P>
PC-Alpine offers considerable mouse support.  You can view what is
&quot;clickable&quot; by dragging your mouse over any screen; when the
arrow cursor changes into a hand, you found something. Mouse-click
possibilities include navigating between screens and folders and
double-clicking on hyperlinks to open your Web browser.
Context-sensitive pop-up menus appear with a right-click on your PC-Alpine
screen.  Examples of right-click options include &quot;copy&quot; after
selecting text to copy and &quot;View in New Window&quot; when you click
on a particular message in the Message Index. The menu choices available
to you will vary based upon what screen is open, where on the screen your
cursor is located, and even what action you have already taken.
Within a folder, you may set the &quot;Important&quot; flag on any
message.
<P>
X terminal mouse support is more limited but still quite powerful.
As with PC-Alpine, clicking on any of the commands in the keymenu at
the bottom of the screen will execute that command as if you typed it.
Double-clicking on a link, for example the link to the
<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-mouse-in-xterm"--> feature in the paragraph above,
will take you to that link.
Double-clicking on an index line will view the message, and so on.

Within a folder, you may set the &quot;Important&quot; flag on any

This doesn't have any system-defined meaning and is only called
the Important flag because many users use it to signify that a message
is important to them in some way.
<P>
You may also define your own set of keywords.
You might know these as user defined flags or as labels.
These are similar to the Important flag but you choose the names for yourself.
<P>
Alpine will only display keywords that
have been added by you in the Flag Details screen or
that have been configured by you using the Setup/Config option
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A>.
Keywords set by other means (for example, by another email client) will not
show up in Alpine unless you configure Alpine to know about them.
They will show up in the Flag Details screen, but will not show up, for example,
in the index line.

<H1>Filtering</H1>

The software that actually delivers mail (the stuff that happens
before Alpine is involved) for you is in a better position to do mail filtering
than Alpine itself.
If possible, you may want to look into using that sort of mail filtering to
deliver mail to different folders, delete it, or forward it.
However, if you'd like Alpine to help with this, Alpine's filtering is for you.

<P>
Filtering is a way to automatically move certain messages from one folder
to another or to automatically delete messages.
You may also automatically set the state (Important, New, Deleted, Answered) of messages
and set <A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A> for messages.
Alpine doesn't have the ability to forward mail to another address or
to deliver vacation messages.

<P>
To configure filtering, go to the MAIN MENU and use the Setup command
followed by &quot;Rules&quot; and then &quot;Filters&quot;.

precedence.
Alpine expects command line arguments (other than addresses) to be

<H1>Alpine Configuration</H1>

Unless it has been administratively disabled, the Setup command on the
MAIN MENU has several subcommands that allow you to modify Alpine's behavior.
The possible subcommands are for general Configuration settings,
Printer settings, Changing your Password, Signature setup,
AddressBook setup, Collection Lists setup, Rules (including Roles, Filters,
Scores, Search, Indexcolor, and Other rules), LDAP Directory setup,
and Color configuration.
In particular, the &quot;Config&quot; subcommand has many features you may
set or unset and many other configuration variables that may be set to change
the way Alpine works.
Every one of the hundreds of options available in that configuration settings
screen has help text associated with it.
You may read that text by moving the cursor to highlight the option and then
typing the Help command.
<P>
These settings are stored in your personal
&quot;pinerc&quot; configuration file (or, optionally, they may be stored
<A HREF="h_config_remote_config">remotely</A>),
but on shared systems these settings
may be over-ridden by a system-wide control file (due to local site
security or support policies).  A global pine configuration file can also
be used to set default values for all Alpine users on a particular system.

<H1>Aggregate Operations</H1>

When you are in the MESSAGE INDEX, the available commands
(for example, Delete, Undelete, Save, Reply, and so on)
normally act on a single message.
So, for example, if you press the Delete command, the currently highlighted
message is marked Deleted.
These commands that normally act on a single message may be applied to
several messages at once instead.
<P>
By default this feature is turned on, but it could be administratively turned
off to reduce complexity.
The feature
<A HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops"><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-aggregate-command-set"--></A>
in the Setup/Config screen is used to turn it off or on.
When this feature is turned on, the four commands &quot;Select&quot;,
&quot;SelectCur&quot;, &quot;ZoomMode&quot;, and &quot;Apply&quot;
are available.
The two selection commands allow you to mark a set of
messages as being &quot;selected&quot;.
The &quot;ZoomMode&quot; command will toggle between
displaying only the selected messages and displaying all the messages.
The &quot;Apply&quot; command allows you to
apply one of the regular MESSAGE INDEX commands to all of the selected
messages instead of to only the highlighted message.
<P>
An example aggregate operation would be to catch up when reading
a news group.
That is, get rid of all the messages in the news group so that you can
start fresh.
The easiest way to do this in Alpine is to use aggregate operations.
You want to Delete all of the messages in the group.
You could start at the top and type &quot;D&quot; once for every message.
A much faster method is to first Select all of the messages in the group,
and then Delete all of them.
This would take four keystrokes:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>; a (to select all messages)</SAMP></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><SAMP>a d (to delete all selected messages)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Another use of Select is to use it for searching for a particular message
or set of messages in a large folder.
You may know that the message was From a certain user.
You could select all messages from that user to start, and use Zoom to
look at only those messages.
If there were still too many messages to look at you could Narrow the
set of messages further by selecting from all of those messages only
the ones that were after a certain date, or contained a particular phrase
in the Subject, or were too a particular address, and so on.
That may be the end of what you are doing, or you may want to use Apply to
Save or Forward or Print all of the selected messages.

<H1>Reading News</H1>

<H2>Background</H2>
Alpine can read and post to Internet (or USENET) newsgroups, using the same 
commands as for mail. Similar to mailing lists but existing on a larger scale, 
Usenet newsgroups allow groups of people with common interests to discuss 
particular topics. You might find newsgroups related to your career, or you 
might wish to check out the online discussion among the fans of your favorite 
television show. 

<H2>Configuring Alpine for Reading News</H2>
Alpine often arrives
pre-configured by your system administrator to automatically access the
newsgroups offered by your organization, Internet Service Provider, or
school. PC-Alpine users, and those attempting to customize Unix Alpine, will
need additional details on <a href="h_configuring_news">how to
configure Alpine to read news</a>.

<H2>Accessing Newsgroups</H2>
The first step in reading news is to access the newsgroups collections
screen from Alpine. If everything is configured properly, you should be able
to do this by first typing L (folder List), then selecting the folder
collection listed as "News." The actual name of this collection may differ
from system to system.

<H2>Subscribing to Newsgroups</H2>

Once you have accessed the news collection, you need to subscribe to a
newsgroup that interests you. Subscribing to a newsgroup means that Alpine
will keep a record of the newsgroups in which you are interested and which
articles in those newsgroups have been read.

<H2>Using Newsgroups</H2> 
Alpine uses the similar commands to read news as to read mail. For example,
the D command marks messages as Deleted (or "Dismissed," if you prefer),
and the R command Replies to a news posting. Basically, Alpine allows you to
read news as if it were mail, so you don't need to change the way you
interact with Alpine.

<DD> When used with the <CODE>-f</CODE> option, apply the <EM>n</EM>th context.
This is used when there are multiple folder collections (contexts) and you 
want to open a folder not in the primary collection.
<P>

<DT> -conf

<DD> Configuration: Prints a sample system configuration file to the
screen or standard output. To generate an initial system configuration 
file, execute

<PRE><CODE>
		pine -conf > <!--#echo var="PINE_CONF_PATH"-->
</CODE></PRE>
<P>

To generate a system configuration file using settings from an old
system configuration file, execute

<PRE><CODE>
		pine -P old-pine.conf -conf > <!--#echo var="PINE_CONF_PATH"-->
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
A system configuration file is not required.
<P>

<DT> -copy_abook &lt;<EM>local_abook_file</EM>&gt; &lt;<EM>remote_abook_folder</EM>&gt;

<DD> Copy an address book file to a remote address book folder.
If the remote folder doesn't exist, it will be created.
If it exists but the first message in the folder isn't a remote address
book header message, the copy will be aborted.
This flag will not usually be used by a user.
Instead, the user will create a remote address book from within <EM>Alpine</EM>
and copy entries from the local address book by using aggregate Save in
the address book screen.
<P>

<DT> -copy_pinerc &lt;<EM>local_pinerc_file</EM>&gt; &lt;<EM>remote_pinerc_folder</EM>&gt;

<DD> Copy a pinerc configuration file to a remote pinerc folder.
If the remote folder doesn't exist, it will be created.
If it exists but the first message in the folder isn't a remote pinerc
header message, the copy will be aborted.
This flag may be useful to users who already have a local pinerc file and
would like to convert it to a remote pinerc folder and use that instead.
This gives a way to bootstrap that conversion without having to manually
reset all of the variables in the remote pinerc folder.
<P>

<DT> -d <EM>debug-level</EM>

<DD> Debug Level:  Sets the level of debugging information written by
<EM>Alpine</EM>.
<EM>debug-level</EM> can be set to any integer 0-9.
A debug level of 0 turns off debugging for the session.
(Actually there are some levels higher than 9, but you probably don't
want to see them.)
<P>

<DT> -d <EM>keywords</EM>

<DD> You may use a more detailed version of the debugging flag to set
the debug level in separate parts of <EM>Alpine</EM>.
The possibilities are flush, timestamp, imap=0..4, tcp, numfiles=0..31, and
verbose=0..9.
<EM>Flush</EM> causes debugging information to be flushed immediately to
the debug file as it is written.
<EM>Verbose</EM> is the general debugging verbosity level.
<EM>Timestamp</EM> causes timestamps to be added to the debug file, which
is useful when you are trying to figure out what is responsible for delays.
<EM>Numfiles</EM> sets the number of debug files saved.
<EM>Imap</EM> sets the debug level for the debugging statements related
to the conversation with the IMAP server, and more generally, for the
debugging related to <EM>Alpine</EM>'s interaction with the C-Client library.
<EM>Tcp</EM> turns on some TCP/IP debugging.
<P>

<DT> -f <EM>folder</EM>

<DD> Startup folder:  <EM>Alpine</EM> will open this folder in place
of the standard INBOX.
<P>

<DT> -F <EM>file</EM>

<DD> Open named text file for viewing and forwarding.
<P>

<DT> -h

<DD> Help:  Prints the list of available command-line arguments to the
screen.
<P>

<DT> -i

<DD> <EM>Alpine</EM> will start up in the FOLDER INDEX
screen instead of the MAIN MENU.
<P>

Configuration equivalent:  <EM><!--#echo var="VAR_initial-keystroke-list"-->=i</EM>.
<P>

<DT> -I <EM>a,b,c,...</EM>

<DD> Initial Keystrokes:  <EM>Alpine</EM> will execute this comma-separated
sequence of commands upon startup.
This allows users to get <EM>Alpine</EM> to start in any
of its menus/screens.
You cannot include any input to the composer in the initial keystrokes.
The key &lt;Return&gt; is represented by a ``CR'' in
the keystroke list; the spacebar is designated by the letters ``SPACE''.
Control keys are two character sequences beginning with ``^'', such as
``^I''.
A tab character is ``TAB''.
Function keys are ``F1'' - ``F12'' and the arrow keys are ``UP'',
``DOWN'', ``LEFT'', and ``RIGHT''.
A restriction is that you can't mix function keys and character keys in this
list even though you can, in some cases, mix them when running <EM>Alpine</EM>.
A user can always use only <EM>character</EM> keys in the startup list even
if he or she is using <EM>function</EM> keys normally, or vice versa.
If an element in this list is a string of characters surrounded by double
quotes (&quot;) then it will be expanded into the individual characters in
the string, excluding the double quotes.
<P>

Configuration equivalent:  <EM><!--#echo var="VAR_initial-keystroke-list"--></EM>
<P>

<DT> -install

<DD> For <EM>PC-Alpine</EM> only, this option prompts the user for
some basic information to help with getting properly set up.
<P>

<DT> -k

<DD> Function-Key Mode:  When invoked in this way, <EM>Alpine</EM> expects
the input of commands to be function-keys.
Otherwise, commands are linked to the regular character keys.

FOLDER INDEX screen with the current message being the specified
message number.
<P>

<DT> -nosplash

<DD> <EM>PC-Alpine</EM> only.
This tells <EM>PC-Alpine</EM> not to display the splash screen upon startup.
This may be helpful for certain troubleshooting or terminal server scenarios.
<P>

<DT> -o <EM>folder</EM>

<DD> Opens the INBOX (or a folder specified via the -f argument) ReadOnly. 
<P>

<DT> -p <EM>pinerc</EM>

<DD> Uses the named file as the personal configuration file instead of
<EM>~/.pinerc</EM> or the default PINERC search sequence <EM>PC-Alpine</EM> uses.
Alpinerc may be either a local file or a remote configuration folder.
<P>

<DT> -P <EM>pinerc</EM>

<DD> Uses the named file as the system wide configuration file instead of
<EM><!--#echo var="PINE_CONF_PATH"--></EM> on UNIX, or nothing on <EM>PC-Alpine</EM>.
Alpinerc may be either a local file or a remote configuration folder.
<P>

<DT> -passfile <EM>passfile</EM>

<DD> This tells <EM>Alpine</EM> what file should be used as the password file.
This should be a fully-qualified filename.
<P>

<DT> -pinerc <EM>file</EM>

<DD> Output fresh pinerc configuration to <EM>file</EM>, preserving the
settings of variables that the user has made.
Use <EM>file</EM> set to ``-'' to make output go to standard out.
<P>

<DT> -r

<DD> Restricted Mode:  For UNIX <EM>Alpine</EM> only.
<EM>Alpine</EM> in restricted mode can only send email to itself.
Save and export are limited.
<P>

<DT> -registry <EM>cmd</EM>

<DD> For <EM>PC-Alpine</EM> only, this option affects the values of 
<EM>Alpine</EM>'s registry entries.
Possible values for <EM>cmd</EM> are set, clear, and dump.
<EM>Set</EM> will always reset <EM>Alpine</EM>'s registry 
entries according to its current settings.
<EM>Clear</EM> will clear the registry values.
<EM>Clearsilent</EM> will clear the registry values without any dialogs.
<EM>Dump</EM> will display the values of current registry settings.
Note that the dump command is currently disabled.
Without the -registry option, <EM>PC-Alpine</EM> will write values into
the registry only if there currently aren't any values set.
<P>

<DT> -sort <EM>key</EM>

<DD> Sort-Key:  Specifies the order messages will be displayed in for the
FOLDER INDEX screen.
<EM>Key</EM> can have the following values: 
arrival, date, subject, orderedsubj, thread, from, size, score, to, cc,
arrival/reverse, date/reverse, subject/reverse, orderedsubj/reverse, thread/reverse,
from/reverse, size/reverse, score/reverse, to/reverse, and cc/reverse.
The default value is &quot;arrival&quot;.
The <EM>key</EM> value reverse is equivalent to arrival/reverse.
<P>

Configuration equivalent:  <EM><!--#echo var="VAR_sort-key"--></EM>.
<P>

<DT> -uninstall

<DD> For <EM>PC-Alpine</EM> only, this option removes references to Alpine
in Windows settings.  The registry settings are removed and
the password cache is cleared.
<P>

<DT> -url <EM>url</EM>

<DD> Open the given URL.

default settings.
<EM>Exceptions_config</EM> may be either a local file or a remote Alpine configuration folder.
<P>

<DT> -z

<DD> Enable Suspend:  When run with this flag, the key sequence ctrl-z
will suspend the <EM>Alpine</EM> session.
<P>

Configuration equivalent:  <EM><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-suspend"--></EM> included in
<EM>Feature-List</EM>.
<P>

<DT> -<EM>option</EM>=<EM>value</EM>

<DD> Assign <EM>value</EM> to the config option <EM>option</EM>.
For example, <EM>-signature-file=sig1</EM> or
<EM>-Feature-List=signature-at-bottom</EM>.
Note:  Feature-List values are
additive and features may be preceded with no- to turn them off.
Also, as a special case, the &quot;Feature-List=&quot; part of that may be

<H1>CONFIGURING NEWS</H1>
Alpine can access news folders in any one of three different ways:
<DL>
<DT>REMOTE NNTP</DT>
<DD>Using the Network News Transport Protocol (NNTP) to
access news on a remote news server.  In this case the newsrc file is
stored on the machine where Alpine is running.

<P>
To specify a remote news-collection accessed via NNTP use the
SETUP/collectionList screen's &quot;Add&quot; command.  Set the
Server: value to the NNTP server's hostname appended with the
communication method &quot;/service=NNTP&quot;, and set the Path:
value to the &quot;#news.&quot; namespace (without the quotes).  See
the &quot;<A HREF="h_composer_cntxt_server">Server:</A>&quot; field's
help text for a more complete explanation of access method, and the
&quot;<A HREF="h_composer_cntxt_path">Path:</A>&quot; field's help
text for a more complete explanation of &quot;namespace&quot;.
<P>
Instead of specifying a news-collection, you may simply set the
<A HREF="h_config_nntp_server">NNTP Server</A>
option, which will cause Alpine to create a default news-collection for you.
Another NNTP option that may be of interest is
<A HREF="h_config_nntprange"><!--#echo var="VAR_nntp-range"--></A>.

<DT>REMOTE IMAP</DT>
<DD>Using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) to
access news on a remote news server.  In this case, your newsrc file is
stored on the news server, in your home directory, so you must have an
account on the news server, but you would be running Alpine on a different
machine.  The news server must be running an IMAPd server process. 

<P>
To specify a remote news-collection accessed via IMAP use the
SETUP/collectionList screen's &quot;Add&quot; command.  Set the
Server: value to the IMAP server's hostname, and set the Path: value
to the &quot;#news.&quot; namespace (without the quotes).  See the
&quot;<A HREF="h_composer_cntxt_path">Path:</A>&quot; field's help
text for a more complete explanation of &quot;namespace&quot;.

</DD>

<DT>LOCAL</DT>
<DD>Using local file access to the news database.  In this
case, your newsrc file is stored on the news server, in your home
directory, so you must have an account on the news server, and you would
be running Alpine on the same machine.

<P>
To specify a local news-collection use the SETUP/collectionList
screen's &quot;Add&quot; command.  Leave the Server: value blank, and
set the Path: value to the &quot;#news.&quot; namespace (without the
quotes).  See the &quot;<A HREF="h_composer_cntxt_path">Path:</A>&quot;
field's help text for a more complete explanation of &quot;namespace&quot;.

</DD>
</DL>

<P>

NOTE: Should no news-collection be defined as above, Alpine will
automatically create one using the Setup/Config screen's
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_nntp-server"-->&quot; variable's value if defined.  The collection
will be created as a &quot;Remote NNTP&quot; as described above.

<P>

If you are a PC-Alpine user, either option 1 (NNTP) or option 2 (IMAP) is
possible.  If you don't have an account on the news server, or if the news
server is not running an IMAP daemon, then you must use NNTP.  (If you are not
sure, ask your service provider, university, or company for help.)  In
this case, your Unix .newsrc file can be transferred to your PC.  A good
place to put it would be in the same directory as your PINERC file, under
the name NEWSRC, but you can 
<A HREF="h_config_newsrc_path">specify a different location</A>
via Alpine's Setup/Config screen.

<P>

<H1>READING NEWS</H1>

Alpine uses almost the same commands for manipulating news folders as for
mail folders.  This means, for example, that when you are done with a
message, you would use &quot;D&quot; to mark it as Deleted (or Dismissed,
if you prefer.)  This &quot;mail-like&quot; behavior differs from that of
most newsreaders, wherein a message is implicitly dismissed after you have
looked at it once. We strongly believe that Alpine should offer as much
consistency as possible between mail and news, so the mail paradigm --
wherein a message does not magically disappear without explicit action by
the user -- is used for news as well. <P>

If you answer a message in a news folder, the index view will show the
&quot;A&quot; flag as usual; but the industry standard file Alpine uses to
keep track of what news as been read has no way of storing this flag, so
it will not be preserved across sessions.  The Deleted flag is the only
one that is preserved when you leave and then return to a newsgroup.  As an
additional note on replies, when you Reply to a newsgroup message and say
you want to reply to all recipients, Alpine will ask if you want to post the
message to all the newsgroups listed in the original message. <P>

If you would like Alpine to mark more-or-less recent news messages as
&quot;New&quot;, then set the
<A HREF="h_config_news_uses_recent">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_news-approximates-new-status"-->&quot;</A>
feature (which is set by default).  This will cause messages after the last one you have marked as
Deleted to appear with &quot;N&quot; status in the MESSAGE INDEX.  The
&quot;N&quot; status often makes it easier to distinguish later news
articles from those you've previously seen, but not yet disposed of via
the &quot;D&quot; key.  Note that this is an approximation, not an exact
record of which messages you have not seen.
<P>

A frequent operation in news-reading is &quot;catching up&quot; -- that
is, getting rid of all the messages in the newsgroup so that you can
&quot;start fresh.&quot;  The easiest way to do this in Alpine is via the
Select command.  You would enter the following four keystrokes:
<tt>;aad</tt> to select all messaged, and then apply the delete (or
dismiss) command to all of them.

<TITLE>Remote Configuration</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>Remote Configuration</H1>

You may use the command line argument &quot;-p pinerc&quot; to tell
Alpine to use a non-default configuration file.
There are two types of storage for configuration information.
<EM>Local</EM> configuration files are used by default.
These are just regular files on the UNIX system or on the PC.
The file &quot;<CODE>.pinerc</CODE>&quot; is the default for Unix Alpine and the
file &quot;<CODE>PINERC</CODE>&quot; is the default for PC-Alpine.
<EM>Remote</EM> configuration folders are stored on an IMAP server.
The advantage of using a remote configuration is that the same information
may be accessed from multiple platforms.
For example, if you use one computer at work and another at home, the same
configuration could be used from both places.
A configuration change from one place would be seen in both places.
To use a remote configuration you simply give a
<A HREF="h_valid_folder_names">remote folder name</A>
as the argument to the &quot;-p&quot; command line option.
The command line might look something like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>pine -p {my.imap.server}remote_pinerc</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If there are special characters in the command shell you use, you may need to
quote the last argument (to protect the curly braces from the shell).
The command might look like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>pine -p &quot;{my.imap.server}remote_pinerc&quot;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
You should choose a folder name for a folder that does not yet exist.
It will be created containing an empty configuration.
Do not use a folder that you wish to store regular mail messages in.
<P>
The Setup/RemoteConfigSetup command will help you convert from a local
configuration to a remote configuration.
It will create a remote configuration for you and copy your current local
configuration to it.
It will also help you convert local address books into remote address books
and local signature files into literal signatures contained in the
remote configuration file.
<P>
If the Setup/RemoteConfigSetup command doesn't do what you want, you
may copy a local pinerc file to a remote configuration folder by hand
by using the command line option &quot;-copy_pinerc&quot;.
<P>
Another command line option, which is somewhat related to remote
configuration, is the option &quot;-x exceptions_config&quot;.
The configuration settings in the exceptions configuration override
your default settings.
It may be useful to store the default configuration (the -p argument) remotely
and to have the exceptions configuration stored in a local file.
You might put generic configuration information in the remote configuration
and platform-specific configuration on each platform in the exceptions
configuration.
The arguments to the &quot;-p&quot; and &quot;-x&quot; options
can be either remote folders or local files.
<P>
There is another command line argument that works only with PC-Alpine and
which may prove useful when using a remote configuration.
The option &quot;-aux local_directory&quot; allows you to tell PC-Alpine where
to store your local auxiliary files.
This only has an effect if your configuration file is remote.
Some examples of auxiliary files are debug files, address book files, and
signature files.

<H1>Generic and Exceptional Configuration</H1>

If you use Alpine from more than one platform it may be convenient
to split your configuration information into two pieces, a generic piece
and exceptions that apply to a particular platform.
For example, suppose you use Alpine from home and from work.
Most of your configuration settings are probably the
same in both locations, so those settings belong in the generic settings
configuration.
However, you may use a different SMTP server and INBOX
from home than you do from work.
The
<A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_smtp-server"-->&quot;</A>
and
<A HREF="h_config_inbox_path">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_inbox-path"-->&quot;</A>
options could be
part of your exceptional configuration so that they could be different in the
two places.
<P>
The command line option &quot;-x exceptions_config&quot;
may be used to split your configuration into generic and exceptional pieces.
&quot;Exceptions_config&quot; may be either local or remote.
The regular Alpine configuration file will contain the generic data, and
&quot;exceptions_config&quot; will contain the exceptional data.
<P>
For Unix Alpine, if you don't have a &quot;-x&quot; command line option,
Alpine will look for the file &quot;<CODE>.pinercex</CODE>&quot;
in the same local directory that the regular config file is located in (usually
the Unix home directory).
If the regular config file is remote (because the command line option
&quot;-p remote_config&quot; was used) then Unix Alpine looks in the Unix home
directory for &quot;<CODE>.pinercex</CODE>&quot;.
If the file does not already exist then no exceptions will be used.
You can force exceptions to be used by using the &quot;-x&quot; option or
by creating an empty &quot;<CODE>.pinercex</CODE>&quot; file.
<P>
For PC-Alpine, if you don't have a &quot;-x&quot; command line option,
PC-Alpine will use the value of the
environment variable <CODE>$PINERCEX</CODE>.
If that is not set, PC-Alpine will look for
the local file &quot;<CODE>PINERCEX</CODE>&quot;
in the same local directory that the regular config file is located in.
If the regular config file is remote (because the command line option
&quot;-p remote_config&quot; was used) then PC-Alpine looks in the
local directory specified by the &quot;-aux local_directory&quot; command
line argument, or the directory <CODE>$HOME&#92;PINE</CODE>, or
in the <CODE>&lt;PINE.EXE </CODE>directory<CODE>&gt;</CODE>.
<P>
When you have an exception configuration there is a new command
in the Alpine Setup screen, Setup/eXceptions.
It toggles between exceptions and the regular configuration.
This is the usual way to make changes in your exceptional configuration data.
For example, you would type &quot;S&quot; for Setup, &quot;X&quot; for
eXception, then follow that with one of the Setup commands, like &quot;C&quot;
for Config or &quot;K&quot; for Kolor.
<P>
For most people, splitting the configuration information into two pieces is
going to be most useful if the generic information is accessed
<A HREF="h_config_remote_config">remotely</A>).
That data will be the same no matter where you access it from and if you
change it that change will show up everywhere.
The exceptional data will most commonly be in a local file, so that the
contents may easily be different on each computing platform used.
<P>
If you already have a local configuration file with settings you like
you may find that the command Setup/RemoteConfigSetup is useful
in helping you convert to a remote configuration.
The command line flag &quot;-copy_pinerc&quot;
may also be useful.

<HEAD>
<TITLE>Configuration Inheritance</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Configuration Inheritance</H1>

Configuration inheritance is a power user feature.
It is confusing and not completely supported by the configuration
user interface.
We start with an explanation of how configuration works in hopes of making
it easier to describe how inheritance works.
<P>
Alpine uses a hierarchy of configuration values from different locations.
There are five ways in which each configuration option (configuration
variable) can be set.
In increasing order of precedence they are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> the system-wide configuration file.

<LI> the personal configuration file

<LI> the personal exceptions file

<LI> a command line argument

<LI> the system-wide <EM>fixed</EM> configuration file (Unix Alpine only)
</OL>
<P>
The fixed configuration file is normally
<CODE><!--#echo var="PINE_CONF_FIXED_PATH"--></CODE>.
<P>
The system-wide configuration file is normally
<CODE><!--#echo var="PINE_CONF_PATH"--></CODE> for Unix Alpine and is normally not
set for PC-Alpine.
For PC-Alpine, if the environment variable <EM>$PINECONF</EM> is set, that
is used for the system-wide configuration.
This location can be set or changed on the command line with the -P flag.
The system-wide configuration file can be either a local file or a
remote configuration folder.
<P>
For Unix Alpine, the personal configuration file is normally the file
<CODE>.pinerc</CODE> in the user's home directory.
This can be changed with the -p command line flag.
For PC-Alpine, the personal configuration file is in
<CODE>$PINERC</CODE> or <CODE>&lt;AlpineRC registry value&gt;</CODE> or 
<CODE>$HOME&#92;PINE&#92;PINERC</CODE> or
<CODE>&lt;PINE.EXE </CODE>dir<CODE>&gt;&#92;PINERC</CODE>.
This can be changed with the -p command line flag.
If -p is used, the configuration data may be in a local file or a remote config
folder.
<P>
For Unix Alpine, the personal exceptions configuration file is named
<CODE>.pinercex</CODE> and is in the same directory as the personal
configuration file, if that configuration file is not remote, and is in
the home directory if the personal configuration file is remote.
If the file exists, then exceptions are turned on.
If it doesn't, then you are not using exceptions.
Alternatively, you may change the location of the exceptions configuration
by using the command line argument &quot;-x &lt;exceptions_config&gt;&quot;.
Like the personal configuration data, exceptions_config may be
either local or remote.
<P>
For PC-Alpine, the personal exceptions configuration file is named
<CODE>PINERCEX</CODE> and is in the same directory as the personal
configuration file unless the personal configuration file is remote.
In that case, it is in the local directory specfied by the
&quot;-aux local_directory&quot; command line argument.
(In the case that the personal configuration is remote and there is no
&quot;-aux&quot; command line argument, Alpine searches for
a PINERCEX file in the directory <CODE>$HOME&#92;PINE</CODE> and
the directory <CODE>&lt;PINE.EXE </CODE>dir<CODE>&gt;</CODE>.)
If the file exists, then exceptions are turned on.
If it doesn't, then you are not using exceptions.
You may change the location of the exceptions configuration
by using the command line argument &quot;-x &lt;exceptions_config&gt;&quot;.
or with the
environment variable <CODE>$PINERCEX</CODE> (if there is no &quot;-x&quot;
option).
<P>
To reiterate, the value of a configuration option is taken from the
last location in the list above in which it is set.
Or, thinking about it slightly differently, a default value for an option
is established in the system-wide configuration file (or internally by Alpine
if there is no value in the system-wide file).
That default remains in effect until and unless it is overridden by a value in a
location further down the list, in which case a new &quot;default&quot;
value is established.
As we continue down the list of locations we either retain the
value at each step or establish a new value.
The value that is still set after going through the whole list of
configuration locations is the one that is used.
<P>
So, for example, if an option is set in the system-wide configuration
file and in the personal configuration file, but is not set in the
exceptions, on the command line, or in the fixed file; then the value
from the personal configuration file is the one that is used.
Or, if it is set in the system-wide config, in the personal config, not
in the exceptions, but is set on the command line; then the value
on the command line is used.
<P>
Finally we get to inheritance.
For configuration options that are lists, like &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_smtp-server"-->&quot; or
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_incoming-folders"-->&quot;,
the inheritance mechanism makes it possible to <EM>combine</EM>
the values from different locations instead of <EM>replacing</EM> the value.
This is true of all configuration lists other than the &quot;Feature-List&quot;,
for which you may already set whatever you want at
any configuration location (by using the &quot;no-&quot; prefix if
necessary).
<P>
To use inheritance, set the first item in a configuration list to the
token &quot;INHERIT&quot;, without the quotes.
If the first item is &quot;INHERIT&quot;,
then instead of replacing the default value established so far, the rest of
the list is appended to the default value established so far and that is
the new value.
<P>
Here is an example which may make it clearer. Suppose we have:
<P>
<PRE>
 System-wide config :   smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com
 Personal config    :   smtp-server = INHERIT, mysmtp.home
 Exceptions config  :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Command line       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Fixed config       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
</PRE>
<P>

This would result in an effective smtp-server option of
<P>
<PRE>
 smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com, mysmtp.home
</PRE>
<P>
The &quot;INHERIT&quot; token can be used in any of the configuration files
and the effect cascades.
For example, if we change the above example to:
<P>
<PRE>
 System-wide config :   smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com
 Personal config    :   smtp-server = INHERIT, mysmtp.home
 Exceptions config  :   smtp-server = INHERIT, yoursmtp.org
 Command line       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Fixed config       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
</PRE>
<P>

This would result in:
<P>
<PRE>
 smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com, mysmtp.home, yoursmtp.org
</PRE>
<P>
Unset variables are skipped over (the default value is carried forward) so
that, for example:
<P>
<PRE>
 System-wide config :   smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com
 Personal config    :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Exceptions config  :   smtp-server = INHERIT, yoursmtp.org
 Command line       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Fixed config       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
</PRE>
<P>

produces:
<P>
<PRE>
 smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com, yoursmtp.org
</PRE>
<P>

If any later configuration location has a value set (for a particular list
option) which does <EM>not</EM> begin with &quot;INHERIT&quot;,
then that value replaces whatever value has been defined up to that point.
In other words, that cancels out any previous inheritance.
<P>
<PRE>
 System-wide config :   smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com
 Personal config    :   smtp-server = INHERIT, mysmtp.org
 Exceptions config  :   smtp-server = yoursmtp.org
 Command line       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Fixed config       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
</PRE>
<P>

results in:
<P>
<PRE>
 smtp-server = yoursmtp.org
</PRE>
<P>

For some configuration options, like &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_viewer-hdr-colors"-->&quot; or
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_patterns-roles"-->&quot;, it is
difficult to insert the value &quot;INHERIT&quot; into the list of values
for the option using the normal Setup tools.
In other words, the color setting screen (for example) does not
provide a way to input the text &quot;INHERIT&quot; as the first
item in the <!--#echo var="VAR_viewer-hdr-colors"--> option.
The way to do this is to either edit the pinerc file directly and manually
insert it, or turn
on the <A HREF="h_config_expose_hidden_config"><!--#echo var="FEAT_expose-hidden-config"--></A>
feature and insert it using the Setup/Config screen.

<TITLE>Explanation of Alpine's XOFF/XON Handling</TITLE>

<H1>XOFF/XON Handling within Alpine</H1>

By default, Alpine treats Ctrl-S or Ctrl-Q (sometimes known as XOFF
and XON) as normal characters, even though Alpine does not use them.
However, the printer, modem, or communication software you are using may
be configured for &quot;software flow control,&quot; which means that
XON/XOFF must be treated as special characters by the operating system.
If you see messages such as &quot;^S not defined for this screen&quot;,
then your system is probably using software flow control. In this case
you will need to set the
<A HREF="h_config_preserve_start_stop">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_preserve-start-stop-characters"-->&quot;</A>
feature.
<P>
If you <EM>do</EM> set this
feature, be advised that if you accidentally hit a Ctrl-S, Alpine will
mysteriously freeze up with no warning.  In this case, try typing a Ctrl-Q
and see if that puts things right.  Printing via the
&quot;attached-to-ansi&quot; or 
&quot;attached-to-wyse&quot;
option will automatically enable software
flow-control handling for the duration of the printing.

<H1>Email List Commands Explained</H1>

Electonic mail lists provide a way for like-minded users to join in
discussions on topics of interest.  The email list itself is 
represented by a
single address that participants send messages to when they have
something of interest to share with other members of the list.  The
receiving computer then, either automatically or after review by the
list's owner (or moderator), sends a copy of that message to each
member of the list.

<P>
Usually, subscribing and unsubscribing is done by sending requests in
an email message to a special address setup to handle managing list
membership.  Often this is the name of the list followed by
<I>-request</I>.  This address is almost <EM>never</EM> the same as
the address used to send messages to the list.

<P>
Unfortunately, email list participation commands are more a matter
of convention than standard, and thus may vary from list to list.
Increasingly, list management software is adding information to
the copy of the postings as they're copied to the list members that
explains how to do the various list management functions.

<P>
Alpine will recognize this information and offer the management commands
they represent in a simple display. One or more of the following
operations will be made available:

<DL>
<DT>Help</DT>
<DD>
A method to get help on subscribing, unsubscribing, 
an explanation of what the list is about, or special instructions
for participation.  This may be in the form of a reply in response
to an email message, or instructions on how to connect to a Web site.
</DD>

<DT>Unsubscribe</DT>
<DD>
A method to get your email addressed removed from the list of
recipients of the email list.
</DD>

<DT>Subscribe</DT>

A method to get your email address added to the list of recipients
of the email list.  It may be in the form of a message sent to

<P> The report for STORAGE is reported in kibibytes (KiB). One kibibyte is 
1024 bytes. Each of the characters that you see in this help text is one 
byte, and this help text is about 1 kibibyte in size. Small messages sent 
by Alpine are normally less than 4 kibibytes in size (which includes 
headers and text). Other email programs may send messages with bigger 
sizes when they send messages, since they send plain text and an 
alternative part in HTML.

<P> A convenient way to save space for the STORAGE type of quota is by 
deleting attachments. This is done on each individual message by pressing 
the &quot;V&quot; command while reading the message text, then moving the cursor 
to the position of the attachment that is to be deleted, then pressing
&quot;D&quot; to delete such attachment, going back to reading the 
message with the &quot;&lt;&quot; command and pressing &quot;S&quot; to 
save the message in the same folder you are reading from. The saved 
message will not have the attachment that was marked deleted. Now you
can delete and expunge the message with the unwanted attachment.

<H2>Description of the THREAD INDEX Screen</H2>

The THREAD INDEX displays summary information from each
thread (conversation) in the current folder.
This is useful if you want to quickly
scan new threads, or find a particular thread without having to go
through the text of each message, or to quickly get rid of junk
threads, etc.
The current thread is always highlighted.
Each line of the THREAD INDEX contains the following columns: <P>
<DL>
 <DT>STATUS:</DT>
 <DD> The markings on the left side of the thread tell you about its
status.  You may see one or more of the following codes on any given
thread:
<UL>
  <LI> &quot;D&quot; for Deleted. All of the messages in this thread are marked for deletion but not yet eXpunged from the folder.
  <LI> &quot;A&quot; for Answered. All of the messages in this thread are marked answered.
  <LI> &quot;N&quot; for New. At least one message in the thread is New (you haven't looked at it yet).
  <LI> &quot;+&quot; for direct-to-you. The &quot;+&quot; indicates that a message in the thread was sent directly to your account, your copy is not part of a cc: or a mailing list.
  <LI> &quot;-&quot; for cc-to-you. The &quot;-&quot; indicates that a
	message in the thread was sent to you as a cc:. This symbol will only show up if
	the feature
	&quot;<A HREF="h_config_mark_for_cc"><!--#echo var="FEAT_mark-for-cc"--></A>&quot; is turned on (which is the default).
  <LI> &quot;X&quot; for selected.  You have selected at least one message in the thread by using the
	&quot;select&quot; command.  (Some systems may optionally allow selected
	messages to be denoted by the index line being displayed in bold
	type instead.)
  <LI> &quot;*&quot; for Important.  You have previously used the &quot;Flag&quot; command
      to mark at least one message in this thread as &quot;important&quot;.
</UL></DD><P>

 <DT>THREAD NUMBER:</DT>
 <DD>Threads in a folder are numbered, from one through the number
of threads in the folder, to help you know where you are in the folder.
</DD><P>

 <DT>DATE STARTED:</DT>
 <DD>The date the thread was started. This is actually from the Date header
of the first message in the thread. It doesn't take different time zones
into account.</DD><P>

 <DT>WHO STARTED THE THREAD:</DT>
 <DD>This is usually the name of the sender of the first message in the thread, taken from
the From header of the message.
If there is no personal name given in that
address, then the email address is used instead.
If the message is from you (or from one of your
<A HREF="h_config_alt_addresses">alternate addresses</A>),
then the recipient's name is shown here instead, with the characters
&quot;To: &quot; inserted before the name.
(The idea of this is that if you started the thread you would rather see who
the mail was sent to instead of that the mail was from you.)
In Newsgroups, if you are
the sender and there are no email recipients, the newsgroup name will be
listed after the &quot;To: &quot;.
</DD><P>

 <DT>SIZE:</DT>
 <DD>The number in parentheses is the number of messages in the thread.</DD><P>

 <DT>SUBJECT:</DT>
 <DD>As much of the thread's subject line as will fit on the screen.
This is the subject of the first message in the thread.</DD>

<H2>Description of the MESSAGE INDEX Screen</H2>

The MESSAGE INDEX displays summary information from each
message in the current folder.
This is useful if you want to quickly
scan new messages, or find a particular message without having to go
through the text of each message, or to quickly get rid of junk
messages, etc.
<P>
The current message is always highlighted
and many commands operate on the current message.
For example, the Delete command will delete the current message.
If the folder is sorted by either Threads or OrderedSubject, then, depending
on some of your configuration settings, a single line in the index may
refer to an entire thread or to a subthread.
If that is the case, then the commands that normally operate on the current
message will operate on the thread or subthread instead.
For example, the Delete command will delete the whole collapsed thread
instead of just a single message.
<P>
Each line of the MESSAGE INDEX contains the following columns (by default -- 
you can change this with the 
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_index_format"><!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--></A>&quot; option
in the SETUP CONFIGURATION screen): <P>
<DL>
 <DT>STATUS:</DT>
 <DD> The markings on the left side of the message tell you about its
status.  You may see one or more of the following codes on any given
message:
<UL>
  <LI> &quot;D&quot; for Deleted.  You have marked this message for deletion but not
	 yet eXpunged the folder.
  <LI> &quot;N&quot; for New.  You have not looked at the text of the message yet.
  <LI> &quot;A&quot; for Answered.  Any time you reply to a message it is considered
	 to be answered.
  <LI> &quot;F&quot; for Forwarded.  Similar to Answered, this is set whenever you
         forward a message.
  <LI> &quot;+&quot; for direct-to-you.  The &quot;+&quot; indicates that a message was sent
	directly to your account, your copy is not part of a cc: or a
	mailing list.
  <LI> &quot;-&quot; for cc-to-you. The &quot;-&quot; indicates that a
	message was sent to you as a cc:. This symbol will only show up if
	the feature
	&quot;<A HREF="h_config_mark_for_cc"><!--#echo var="FEAT_mark-for-cc"--></A>&quot; is turned on (which is the default).
  <LI> &quot;X&quot; for selected.  You have selected the message by using the
	&quot;select&quot; command.  (Some systems may optionally allow selected
	messages to be denoted by the index line being displayed in bold
	type.)
  <LI> &quot;*&quot; for Important.  You have previously used the &quot;Flag&quot; command
      to mark this message as &quot;important&quot;.
</UL></DD><P>

 <DT>MESSAGE NUMBER:</DT>
 <DD>Messages in a folder are numbered, from one through the number
of messages in the folder, to help you know where you are in the folder.
These numbers are always in increasing order, even if you sort the folder
in a different way.</DD><P>

 <DT>DATE SENT:</DT>
 <DD>The date the message was sent.  By default, messages are
ordered by arrival time, not by date sent.  Most of the time, arrival time
and date sent (effectively departure time) are similar.  Sometimes,
however, the index will appear to be out of order because a message took a
long time in delivery or because the sender is in a different time
zone than you are. This date is just the date from the Date header
field in the message.</DD><P>

 <DT>WHO SENT THE MESSAGE:</DT>
 <DD>This is usually the name of the sender of the message, taken from
the From header of the message.
If there is no personal name given in that
address, then the email address is used instead.
If the message is from you (or from one of your
<A HREF="h_config_alt_addresses">alternate addresses</A>),
then the recipient's name is shown here instead, with the characters
&quot;To: &quot; inserted before the name.
(The idea of this is that if you sent the mail you would rather see who
the mail was sent to instead of that the mail was from you.
This behavior may be changed by modifying the <!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--> option mentioned
above.
In particular, use the FROM token or the FROMORTONOTNEWS token
in place of the FROMORTO token.)
In Newsgroups, if you are
the sender and there are no email recipients, the newsgroup name will be
listed after the &quot;To: &quot;. </DD><P>

 <DT>SIZE:</DT>
 <DD>The number in parentheses is the number of characters in the message.
It may have a suffix of K, M, or G which means the number should be
multiplied by one thousand, one million, or one billion to get the
size of the message.</DD><P>

 <DT>SUBJECT:</DT>
 <DD>As much of the message's subject line as will fit on the screen.</DD>

<H2>Description of the MESSAGE TEXT Screen</H2>

The top line of the view message screen displays status
information about the currently open collection and folder and about the
current message.  It shows the name of the collection in angle brackets
and then the name of the folder.  The line also displays the number
of messages in the folder, the number of the current message and the
percentage of the current message that has been displayed on the screen.
If the message is marked for deletion &quot;DEL&quot; will appear in the upper
right corner.
If the message has been answered (but not deleted) &quot;ANS&quot; will show
in the corner.
<P>

NOTE: to rapidly move to the end of a message, hit the
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F8<!--chtml else-->W<!--chtml endif-->
(or Ctrl-W) key followed
by Ctrl-V.  Similarly,
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F8<!--chtml else-->W<!--chtml endif-->
followed by Ctrl-Y will take you to the beginning of
a message.

<H2>Explanation of Alternate Character Sets</H2>

Alpine attempts to stay out of the way so that it won't prevent you from
viewing mail in any character set.  It will simply send the message to
your display device.  If the device is capable of displaying the
message as it was written it will do so.  If not, the display may be
partially or totally incorrect.
If the message contains characters that are not representable in your 
<A HREF="h_config_char_set">&quot;Display Character Set&quot;</A>
variable in your configuration, then a warning message will be printed
to your screen at the beginning of the message display.
It is probably best to use UNIX Alpine in a terminal emulator
capable of displaying UTF-8 characters.
See <A HREF="h_config_char_set">Display Character Set</A> for a little
more information about character set settings.

<TITLE>Selecting: Select and WhereIs/Select</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Selecting: Select and WhereIs/Select</H1>

Aggregate operations give you the ability to process a group of messages
at once.  Acting on multiple messages requires two steps: (1) selecting a
set of messages and then; (2) applying a command to that set. The first
part is handled by the select command.  Select allows you to
select messages based on their status (read, answered, etc.), contents,
date, size, or keywords.
You may also select based on one of your Rules or based on threads,
and there are quick options to select a specific message or range of messages,
to select the current message, or to select all messages.
<P>

We describe the various selection criteria briefly:
<P>

<DL>
<DT>select All</DT>
<DD> Marks all the messages in the folder as selected.
</DD>

<DT>select Cur</DT>
<DD> Selects the currently highlighted message or currently highlighted
set of messages if in a threaded view.
</DD>

<DT>select by Number</DT>
<DD> Select by message number. This may be a comma-separated list instead or
a single entry.
Each element in the list may be either a single message number or a range
of numbers with a dash between the lowest and highest member of the range.
Some examples are 7 to select only message number 7; 2-5 to select messages
2 through 5; and 2-5,7-9,11 to select messages 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11.
The word &quot;end&quot; or the character &quot;$&quot; may be used as a 
substitute for the highest numbered message in the folder, while the
character &quot;.&quot; represents the message number holding the position
of the cursor in the folder.
If in a separate thread index where the numbers refer to threads instead of
to messages, then you will be selecting all of the messages in the
referenced threads instead of selecting by message number.
</DD>

<DT>select by Date</DT>
<DD> Select by either the date stored in the Date headers of each message,
or by the date when the messages arrived.
This does not adjust for different time zones, but just checks to see what
day the message was sent on.
You may type in a date. If you do, the date should be in the form
<P><SAMP><CENTER>DD-Mon-YYYY</CENTER></SAMP><P>
For example,
<P><SAMP><CENTER>24-Nov-2004</CENTER></SAMP><P>
or
<P><SAMP><CENTER>09-Nov-2004</CENTER></SAMP><P>
If the date you want is close to the current date, it is probably
easier to use the &quot;^P&nbsp;Prev Day&quot; or &quot;^N&nbsp;Next Day&quot; commands to change the default date that
is displayed, instead of typing in the date yourself.
Or, the &quot;^X&nbsp;Cur Msg&quot; command may be used to fill in
the date of the currently highlighted message. 
<P>
There are six possible settings that are selected using the
&quot;^W&nbsp;Toggle When&quot; command.
Three of them select messages based on the Date headers.
They are &quot;SENT SINCE&quot;, &quot;SENT BEFORE&quot;,
and &quot;SENT ON&quot;.
SINCE is all messages with the selected date or later.
BEFORE is all messages earlier than the selected date (not including the day
itself).
ON is all messages sent on the selected date.
The other three select messages in the same way but they use the arrival
times of the messages instead of the Date headers included in the messages.
Those three are &quot;ARRIVED SINCE&quot;, &quot;ARRIVED BEFORE&quot;,
and &quot;ARRIVED ON&quot;.
When you save a message from one folder to another the arrival time is
preserved.
</DD>

<DT>select by Text</DT>
<DD> Selects messages based on the message contents.
This allows you to select a set of messages based on whether or not the
message headers or message body contain specified text.
You may look for text in the Subject, the From header,
the To header, or the Cc header.
You may also choose Recipient, which searches for the text in
either the To or the Cc header;
or Participant, which means To or Cc or From.
Besides those specific header searches, you may also search the entire
header and text of the message with &quot;All Text&quot;, or just the
body of the message.
<P>
To search for the absence of text, first type the &quot;! Not&quot; command
before typing the specific type of text search.
For example, you could type &quot;!&quot; followed by &quot;S&quot; to
search for all messages that do not contain a particular word in their
Subjects.
<P>
If you choose a Subject search, you may use the subject from the current
message by typing the &quot;^X Cur Subject&quot; command.
You may then edit it further if you wish.
For example, you might select the subject of a reply and edit the
&quot;Re:&nbsp;&quot; off of the front of it in order to search for
the original message being replied to.
All of the other header searches allow you to use addresses from the
headers of the current message if you want to.
You may use the &quot;^T Cur To&quot;, &quot;^R Cur From&quot;, or
&quot;^W Cur Cc&quot;.
In each case, if there is more than one address, only the first is offered.
</DD>

<DT>select by Status</DT>
<DD> Selects messages based on their status.
You may select all New, Important, Deleted, Answered, Recent, or Unseen
messages.
Or, if you first type the &quot;! Not&quot; command, you get not New,
or not Important, and so on.
If you select Deleted messages, you will get all messages with their
Deleted flag set.
Likewise for Important messages, all messages that you have flagged as
being Important with the
<A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag</A> command.
The &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Answered&quot; choices are a little bit odd
because they try to match what you see on the screen by default.
&quot;New&quot; is a shorthand for messages that are Unseen, Undeleted,
and Unanswered.
If you have looked at the message, or deleted it, or answered it; then it
is not considered &quot;New &quot;.
&quot;!&nbsp;New&quot; is the opposite of &quot;New&quot;.
<P>
&quot;Answered&quot; is another one that is a little different.
It means that the message has been Answered <EM>and</EM> is not deleted.
And to make it even more confusing, &quot;!&nbsp;Answered&quot; is not
the opposite of &quot;Answered&quot;!
Instead, &quot;!&nbsp;Answered&quot; stands for messages that are
both Unanswered <EM>and</EM> not deleted.
<P>
The other two types were added later because the special nature of the
New flag was not what was wanted by all users.
New does match what you see in the index by default, but if you use
the IMAPSTATUS or SHORTIMAPSTATUS token in the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_index_format"><!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--></A>&quot; it may not
be exactly what you want.
&quot;Unseen&quot; simply selects all unseen messages, whether or not
they are deleted or answered, and
&quot;Recent&quot; selects all of the messages that have been added to
the folder since you started this Alpine session.
(That's not technically quite true. If there are multiple mail clients
reading an IMAP mailbox, each message will be marked as Recent in only
one of the client's sessions.)
</DD>

<DT>select by siZe</DT>
<DD> Selects messages based on their size being smaller than or larger
than the size you specify.
The size is the number of bytes.
You may use the suffix &quot;K&quot; or &quot;k&quot; to mean 1,000 times
the number.
For example, 7K is the same as 7000.
The suffix &quot;M&quot; or &quot;m&quot; means 1,000,000 times the number,
and the suffix &quot;G&quot; or &quot;g&quot; means 1,000,000,000 times.
Use the &quot;^W&quot; command to toggle back and forth between Smaller
and Larger.

<DT>select by Keyword</DT>
<DD> Selects messages that either have or do not have
(using the &quot;!&nbsp;Not&quot; command)
a particular <A HREF="h_config_keywords">Keyword</A> set.
One way to select a keyword is to use the &quot;^T&nbsp;To&nbsp;List&quot;
command to select one from your list of keywords.
The
<A HREF="h_config_flag_screen_kw_shortcut"><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-flag-screen-keyword-shortcut"--></A> option allows selecting by Keyword initials if set.
</DD>

<DT>select by Rule</DT>
<DD> Selects messages that either match or don't match
(using the &quot;!&nbsp;Not&quot; command)
one of the Rules you have defined.
The most likely method of filling in the Rule is to use the
&quot;^T&nbsp;To&nbsp;List&quot;
command to select one of your Rules.
All of the Rules you have defined will be in the list, including
Rules for Searching, Indexcolors, Filtering, Roles, Score setting, and Other.
They may not all make sense for this purpose, but they are all there for
flexibility.
You might find it useful to define some rules solely for the purpose
of being used by the Select command.
There is a special category for such Rules. They are called Search Rules.
<P>
Unfortunately, Alpine does not allow all possible Rules to be defined.
For example, there is no logical OR operation.
OR is accomplished in the Filter Rules or the other types of Rules by
simply defining two rules, one that matches the first part of the OR
and another that matches the second part.
But you can't do that here, since you only have a single Rule to work with.
Likewise, the order of Rules is usually important.
For example, if the first Filter Rule (or Indexcolor rule or ...) matches
a message, then that stops the search for a further match.
This means that you may be confused if you try to use Select by Rule to
check your Filter rules because the order is important when filtering but
is not considered here.
</DD>

<DT>select by tHread</DT>
<DD> Selects all of the messages in the current thread.
</DD>
</DL>

After you have an initial selection, the next and subsequent selection
commands modify the selection.
The select command changes. It first gives
you selection &quot;alteration&quot; options: &quot;unselect All&quot;,
&quot;unselect Current&quot;,
&quot;Broaden selection&quot; (implements a logical OR), and
&quot;Narrow selection&quot; (implements a logical AND).
After you choose either Broaden or Narrow, you then choose one of the
selection criteria listed above (by Text or Number or ...).
You may use select as many times as you wish to get the selected set right.
<P>

The WhereIs command has a feature (Ctrl-X) to
select all the messages that match the WhereIs search. WhereIs searches
through just the text that appears on the MESSAGE INDEX screen.
This method is often slower than using the select command itself, unless the
line you are looking for is not too far away in the index.
<P>

The availability of the aggregate operations commands is determined by the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-aggregate-command-set"-->&quot;</A>
Feature-List option in your Alpine
configuration, which defaults to set.
The features

and
<A HREF="h_config_select_wo_confirm">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_select-without-confirm"-->&quot;</A>

<H1>Select: Text</H1>

You are selecting messages based on the contents of the message.
This allows you to select a set of messages based on whether or not the
message headers or message body contain specified text.
You may look for text in the Subject, the From header,
the To header, or the Cc header.
You may also choose Recipient, which searches for the text in
either the To or the Cc header;
or Participant, which means either the To header, or the Cc header,
or the From header.
Besides those specific header searches, you may also search the entire
header and text of the message with &quot;All Text&quot;, or just the
body of the message with &quot;Body&quot;.
<P>
To search for the absence of text, first type the &quot;!&nbsp;Not&quot; command
before typing the specific type of text search.
For example, you could type &quot;!&quot; followed by &quot;S&quot; to
search for all messages that do not contain a particular word in their
Subjects.
<P>
If you choose a Subject search, you may use the subject from the current
message by typing the &quot;^X Cur Subject&quot; command.
You may then edit it further if you wish.
For example, you might select the subject of a reply and edit the
&quot;Re:&nbsp;&quot; off of the front of it in order to search for
the original message being replied to.
All of the other header searches allow you to use addresses from the
headers of the current message if you want to.
You may use the &quot;^T Cur To&quot;, &quot;^R Cur From&quot;, or
&quot;^W Cur Cc&quot;.
In each case, if there is more than one address, only the first is offered.

<TITLE>Select: Status</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>Select: Status</H1>

You are selecting messages based on the status of the message.
For example, whether or not the message has been marked Deleted or Important,
or whether or not it has been Answered or is New.
If you first type the &quot;!&nbsp;Not&quot; command, you will get the
opposite: not Deleted, not Important, and so on.
<P>
If you select Deleted messages, you will get all messages with their
Deleted flag set.
Likewise for Important messages, all messages that you have flagged as
being Important with the
<A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag</A> command.
The &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Answered&quot; choices are a little bit odd
because they try to match what you see on the screen by default.
&quot;New&quot; is a shorthand for messages that are Unseen, Undeleted,
and Unanswered.
If you have looked at the message, or deleted it, or answered it; then it
is not considered &quot;New &quot;.
&quot;!&nbsp;New&quot; is the opposite of &quot;New&quot;.
<P>
&quot;Answered&quot; is another one that is a little different.
It means that the message has been Answered <EM>and</EM> is not deleted.
And to make it even more confusing, &quot;!&nbsp;Answered&quot; is not
the opposite of &quot;Answered&quot;!
Instead, &quot;!&nbsp;Answered&quot; stands for messages that are
both Unanswered <EM>and</EM> not deleted.
<P>
(The New and Answered options may seem counter-intuitive.
The reason it is done this way is
because, by default, a Deleted message will show up with the &quot;D&quot;
symbol in the MAIL INDEX screen even if it is New or Answered.
The Delete symbol overrides the New and Answered symbols, because you
usually don't care about the message anymore once you've deleted it.
Similarly, you usually only care about whether a message is Answered or
not if it is not Deleted.
Once it is Deleted you've put it out of your mind.)
<P>
The other two options were added later because the special nature of the
New flag was not what was wanted by all users.
New does match what you see in the index by default, but if you use
the IMAPSTATUS or SHORTIMAPSTATUS token in the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_index_format"><!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--></A>&quot; it may not
be exactly what you expect.
&quot;Unseen&quot; simply selects all unseen messages, whether or not
they are deleted or answered, and
&quot;Recent&quot; selects all of the messages that have been added to
the folder since you started this Alpine session.
(That's not technically quite true. If there are multiple mail clients
reading an IMAP mailbox, each message will be marked as Recent in only
one of the client's sessions.
That behavior can be convenienent for some purposes, like filtering, but
it isn't usually what you expect when selecting.)

Apply
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F6<!--chtml else-->A<!--chtml endif-->)

becomes active any time there is a defined set of selected messages.  The
following commands can be applied to a selected message set: delete,
undelete, reply, forward,
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
<!--chtml else--> 
pipe,
<!--chtml endif-->
print, take address, save, export, bounce, and flag.

ZoomMode
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F3<!--chtml else-->Z<!--chtml endif-->)
is a toggle command that allows you to
zoom-in (and only see the selected messages) and zoom-out (to see all
messages in the folder).  Neither apply nor zoom removes the markings that
define the selected set; you need to use a select command in order
to do that.

<A HREF="h_config_thread_disp_style"><!--#echo var="VAR_threading-display-style"--></A>
is set to something other than &quot;none&quot;.
By default, this command collapses or expands the subthread that starts at
the currently highlighted message, if any.
If the subthread is already collapsed, then this command expands it.
If the subthread is expanded, then this command collapses it.
If there are no more messages below the current message in the
thread tree (that is, there are no replies to the current message) then
this command does nothing.

<P>
The behavior of this command is affected by the option
<A HREF="h_config_slash_coll_entire">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_slash-collapses-entire-thread"-->&quot;</A>.
Normally, this command Collapses or Expands the subthread that

<P>
The Reverse option will toggle the order the index is currently
sorted by, but will not change the relative sort order.

<P>
Sorting a folder does not actually rearrange the way the folder is saved,
it just re-arranges how the messages are presented to you.  This means
that Alpine has to do the work of sorting every time you change sort order.
Sometimes, especially with PC-Alpine or with large folders, this could take
a while.

The WhereIs
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F8<!--chtml else-->W<!--chtml endif-->)
command lets you search the MESSAGE INDEX for a word.
It scans through whatever you see, usually the name of the author
and the Subject line.
WhereIs has special subcommands to let you find the beginning of the
index (Ctrl-Y -- first message)
or the end of the index (Ctrl-V -- last message).
<P>
Note that WhereIs only searches through the visible text on the screen.
For example, if only part of the Subject of a message is shown because it
is long, then only the visible portion of the Subject is searched.
Also note that WhereIs does not &quot;see&quot; the 
&quot;X&quot; in column one of Index entries for selected messages
so it can't be used to search for
selected messages (use &quot;Zoom&quot; instead).
<P>
If the feature
<A HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-aggregate-command-set"-->&quot;</A>
is turned on,
WhereIs can also be used as a quick way to select messages that match the
string being searched for.
Instead of typing carriage return to search for the next match, type
Ctrl-X to select all matches.
Once again, this only selects matches that are (or would be if the right
index line was on the screen) visible.
Truncated From lines or Subjects will cause matches to be missed.
Although WhereIs is sometimes convenient for quick matching, the Select
command is usually more powerful and usually faster.

Expunge/Exclude
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F3<!--chtml else-->X<!--chtml endif-->)
is the command Alpine uses to actually remove all messages
marked for deletion.  With regular email files, expunge literally deletes
the text from the current folder.  With newsgroups or shared mailboxes,
you don't have permission to actually remove the message, so it is an
exclude -- Alpine removes the message from your view of the folder even
though it is not technically gone.

<P> A selective expunge command is available in IMAP folders that support 
the UID EXPUNGE extension in <A 
HREF="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4315">RFC 4315</A> as well as for all 
other folders (local folders in all formats, POP3 inbox, and newsgroups) 
as a subcommand of the apply command. If some selected messages are marked 
deleted, then the apply command will offer the eXpunge command, which when 
executed will only expunge those messages that are selected and deleted.

<P> 
Observe that the expunge command (when not used from the apply command) 
will expunge/exclude all deleted messages from the folder, and so all 
messages marked deleted will be expunged, regardless of if they are 
selected or not. In other words, there is no protection against 
potentially expunging more messages than only those that have been 
selected and deleted.

The Compose command takes you into the Alpine message composer where you
can start a new message for sending.  This is where you type in the
message's text and specify its recipient list (the &quot;To:&quot;

&quot;Cc:&quot; or &quot;Bcc:&quot;), and which files, if any, should
be attached to the message.

<P>
When you type this command, Alpine will also automatically check for any
interrupted (i.e., a message that was being composed when your modem
or network connection was broken) or previously postponed messages and
offer you a chance to continue working on those.

<H1>NextNew Command</H1>

When you press the TAB key, Alpine advances to the next
&quot;interesting&quot; message.
This will be the next message you have not seen before, or the next message
you have flagged Important, whichever comes first.
Unread messages that have been deleted are not considered interesting.
(A note about reading news. Alpine expects you to &quot;Delete&quot; news
articles after you have read them if you want to remove them from future
consideration. See <A HREF="h_mainhelp_readingnews">Reading News</A> for
more information.)

<P>
The NextNew command is affected by the feature
<A HREF="h_config_tab_new_only">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_tab-visits-next-new-message-only"-->&quot;</A>,
which causes Alpine to only consider Unread messages interesting, not messages
flagged Important.

<P>
This command behaves a little differently when it finds there are no more
interesting messages left in the current folder.
If the current folder is one of your Incoming Message Folders
(<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-incoming-folders"-->&quot;</A>)
or it is a newsgroup, then Alpine will try to find the next folder or
newsgroup that contains <EM>Recent</EM> messages and will ask you
if you want to open that folder.
This behavior may be modified by using the
<A HREF="h_config_tab_uses_unseen">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_tab-uses-unseen-for-next-folder"-->&quot;</A>
feature that causes Alpine to look for Unseen messages instead of Recent
messages.
The NextNew command's behavior is also affected by the configuration features
<A HREF="h_config_auto_open_unread">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_auto-open-next-unread"-->&quot;</A>,

Flag
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F11<!--chtml else-->*<!--chtml endif-->)
is the command that allows users to manipulate the status flags that
appear on the left side of the MESSAGE INDEX screen.  The most common
use of this is to mark a message as important. This is something of a
note to yourself to get back to that message.  You may also use the
flag command to set (or unset) the flags that indicate that a message
is new, answered, deleted, or forwarded.<P>

Provided the mail server supports it,
you may also manipulate user-defined keywords
for a message using the flag command.
These keywords will be available if you use the Flag Details screen that you
can get to after typing the
Flag (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F11<!--chtml else-->*<!--chtml endif-->)
command.
They will be listed after the Important, New, Answered, Deleted , and Forwarded flags,
which are always present.
You may add new keywords by using the Add KW command from the Flag Details screen
or by defining them in the <A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A> option in the Setup/Config screen.

The availability of the flag command is determined by the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_flag">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-flag-cmd"-->&quot;</A>
feature in your Alpine configuration. Also, it is possible that Flag could be
administratively disabled by your system manager; if it doesn't work,
please check with your local help desk before reporting a bug.
The behavior of the flag command may be modified by the

<BODY>
<H1>HdrMode Command</H1>

Every email message comes with some header lines that you normally
don't see (and don't want to see).
These include anywhere from 3-20 lines (or more) added by the
Internet mail transport system to record the route your message took,
for diagnostic purposes.
These are normally of no import and simply
add clutter, so Alpine suppresses them in the MESSAGE TEXT display.
This also includes other non-standard headers the message may contain.
If you want to see these headers, there is a way to reveal them.
<P>

The Header Mode
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F9<!--chtml else-->H<!--chtml endif-->)
command is a toggle that controls Alpine's handling of these header
lines.  Normally, full headers is &quot;off&quot; and you only see a
few lines about who a message is to and who it is from.  When you
press
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F9<!--chtml else-->H<!--chtml endif-->)
to turn full headers on, Alpine will show you
the normal header lines as well as delivery headers, comment headers,
MIME headers, and any other headers present.
<P>

Several different Alpine commands honor the header mode -- it affects how
messages are displayed, how they appear in forward and reply email, how
they are printed, how they are saved, and how they are exported.
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
<!--chtml else--> 
The pipe command is also affected.
<!--chtml endif-->
<P>

The presence or absence of the Header Mode command is determined by the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_full_hdr">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-full-header-cmd"-->&quot;</A>
Feature-List option in your Alpine configuration.

<P>
If you have also turned on the
<A HREF="h_config_quote_suppression">&quot;Quote Suppression&quot;</A>
option then the HdrMode command actually rotates through three states
instead of just two.
The first is the normal view with long quotes suppressed.
The second is the normal view but with the long quotes included.
The last enables the display of all headers in the message.
When using Export, Pipe, Print, Forward, or Reply the quotes are
never suppressed, so the first two states are identical.

<P>
The behavior of the Header Mode command may be altered slightly by
turning on the
<A HREF="h_config_quell_full_hdr_reset">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-full-header-auto-reset"-->&quot;</A>
Feature-List option in your Alpine configuration.
In particular, it will cause the Header Mode to be persistent when moving
from message to message instead of resetting to the default for each message.

selection screen that lets you choose the address you want to save into
your address book, or lets you choose several of them add to a
personal distribution list.

Once you've added an entry to your address book, you can use it from the

You may turn it back off by typing &quot;^P&quot; again, which will now
be labeled &quot;NoAllParts&quot; instead.
If you want to save the parts the command displayed should be
&quot;NoAllParts&quot;!
When you choose to save attachments like this, the attachments will be saved
in a newly created directory.
That directory will have the same name as the file name you choose here,
with the letters &quot;.d&quot; appended.
If that directory already exists, then the letters &quot;.d_1&quot; will
be tried, then &quot;.d_2&quot; and so on until a name that doesn't exist
is found.
For example, if you select the file name
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>filename</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
to export the message to, then the directory used for the attachments will be
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>filename.d</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or perhaps
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>filename.d_&lt;n&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The attachments will then be put into files inside that directory.
The names for the attachment files will be derived from the attachments
if possible.
This is done in the same way as the default values are derived if you
save them one at a time.
(The &quot;filename&quot; parameter from the Content-Disposition header
is the first choice. If that doesn't exist, the &quot;name&quot;
parameter from the Content-Type header is used.)
If a name for a particular attachment is not available, then the
part number of the attachment is used, with the characters &quot;part_&quot;
prepended.
An example of that would be
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>part_2.1</SAMP></CENTER>

When you Save a message, it is put into an existing folder or into a new

When you use Export, the message is placed in a plain text file in your
home directory 
<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
(which, in the present configuration of your system, is
 &quot;<!--#echo var="HOME_DIR"-->&quot;)

<H1>Bounce Command</H1>

The Bounce 
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F10<!--chtml else-->B<!--chtml endif-->)
command allows you to re-send, or &quot;remail&quot;, a
message, as if you were never in the loop.  It is analogous to crossing
out your address on a postal letter, writing a different address on the
envelope, and putting it into the mailbox. Bounce is used primarily to
redirect email that was sent to you in error.
Also, some owners of email
lists need the bounce command to handle list traffic.
Bounce is not anonymous.
A ReSent-From header is added to the message so that the recipient may
tell that you Bounced it to them.
<P>

The presence or absence of the Bounce command is determined by the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_bounce">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-bounce-cmd"-->&quot;</A>
feature in your Alpine configuration.
The feature
<A HREF="h_config_fcc_on_bounce">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_fcc-on-bounce"-->&quot;</A>
affects the behavior of the Bounce command.
Also, it is possible that Bounce could be
administratively disabled by your system manager; if it doesn't work,
please check with your local help desk before reporting a bug.

<H1>Reply and Forward Commands</H1>

Replying 
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F11<!--chtml else-->R<!--chtml endif-->)
and Forwarding 
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F12<!--chtml else-->F<!--chtml endif-->)
are your two alternatives for following up on the
message you are reading.  You would use reply if you want to get email
back to the author of the message and/or the other people who have
already seen it.  You use forward if you want somebody new to see the
message.
<P>

In the normal case, the only thing that you must supply when forwarding a
message is the name/email address of the new recipient.
Alpine will include the text of the forwarded message.
Alpine will also include any attachments to the message.
There is space above the forwarded text for you to include additional comments.
<P>

When replying, you usually have to answer some questions.
If the message is to multiple people and/or specified with a Reply-To: header,
then you will have to decide who should get the reply.
You also need to decide whether or not to include the previous
message in your reply.
Some of this is configurable.
Specifically, see the
<A HREF="h_config_include_header">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_include-header-in-reply"-->&quot;</A>,
<A HREF="h_config_auto_include_reply">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_include-text-in-reply"-->&quot;</A>,
<A HREF="h_config_attach_in_reply">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_include-attachments-in-reply"-->&quot;</A>,
and
<A HREF="h_config_auto_reply_to">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_reply-always-uses-reply-to"-->&quot;</A>
configuration features.
<P>

Both the Reply and Forward commands react to the full header mode toggle.
If the full header mode is on, then all the header and delivery lines are
included with the text of the message in your reply/forward.
<P>

Other configuration features that affect the Reply command are
<A HREF="h_config_sig_at_bottom">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_signature-at-bottom"-->&quot;</A>,
<A HREF="h_config_sigdashes">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-sigdashes"-->&quot;</A>, and

(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F10<!--chtml else-->U<!--chtml endif-->)
allow you to change the Deleted flag for the current message.
Delete marks a message Deleted (turns on the Deleted flag) and Undelete
removes the mark.
In the MESSAGE INDEX, deleted messages have a &quot;D&quot; in the status field
at the left hand edge of the index line.
When viewing a deleted message, the letters &quot;DEL&quot; will be present
in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
Delete simply <EM>marks</EM> a message Deleted, it does not actually
get rid of the message.
The eXpunge command (available from the MESSAGE INDEX screen) actually
removes all of the deleted messages in a folder.
Once a message is eXpunged, it can't be retrieved.

When entering addresses in the address fields of the composer (To, Cc, etc.)
the TAB key may be used to help complete the address.
Type a partial nickname and tap the TAB key to complete the typing.
The unambiguous part of the name will be filled in automatically.
Typing TAB twice in succession will bring up a selection list of possibilities,
making it easy to find and choose the correct address.

<P>
The matching algorithm is rather ad hoc.
The search starts with a search of your address book.
It counts as a match if the nickname, address, or fullname field of an
entry begins with the text typed in so far. It is also a match if
a later word in the fullname (for example, the middle name or last name)
begins with the entered text.
<P>
Next comes an LDAP search.
The search will happen for any servers that have the

The Rich Header command allows you to toggle between the list of

This set usually includes the

headers.
If you are posting to a newsgroup the set of defaults is a little different.

&quot;Cc:&quot;,
&quot;Bcc:&quot;,

<H1>Justify Command</H1>

The Justify
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
(F4)
<!--chtml else-->
(^J) 
<!--chtml endif-->
command reformats the text in the paragraph the cursor is in.
Paragraphs are separated by one blank line or a line beginning with a space.
This is useful when you have been editing a paragraph and the lines become
uneven.  The text is left aligned or justified and the right is ragged.  If
the text is already justified as typed with auto-wrap, no justification will
be done.

<P>
If you have set a <A HREF="h_compose_markcutpaste">mark</A> to select a
block of text, the Justify command is modified.
Instead of automatically justifying the current paragraph you will be
asked if you want to justify the paragraph, justify the selected region,
or adjust the quote level of the selected region.
Adjusting the quote level only works if you are using standard
&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot; quotes, which is the default if you haven't
changed &quot;<A HREF="h_config_reply_indent_string"><!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"--></A>&quot;.

<P>
When composing a reply containing included text, the justify command
will reformat text to the right of the 
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_reply_indent_string"><!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"--></A>&quot;,
adding or removing indented lines as needed.  Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line, a line containing only the <!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"-->, or a
line containing the indent string and one or more blank spaces.
Included text that was previously indented (or &quot;quoted&quot;) is
not preserved.

<P>
Because of the introduction of <A HREF="h_config_quell_flowed_text">Flowed Text</A>
in 1999 and its wide-spread adoption since then, you will usually be better off if you
use the standard

<H1>Pipe Command SubOptions</H1>

By default, when you use the Pipe command, the processed text of the
message is sent to the Unix command
you specify and the output is captured by Alpine and shown to you.
(This command is available in PC-Alpine, as well, but there aren't many
Windows commands that work well with piping.)
There are some sub-commands that may be used to alter this behavior.
These are toggles that switch the behavior between two possibilities.
They can be combined in any way you wish.
<P>
By default, the prompt at the bottom of the screen looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe message 37 to :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe messages to :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
if you are piping more than one message.
<P>
The sub-command options are:
<DL>
   <DT>Shown Text or Raw Text</DT>
   <DD>This option toggles between sending the shown (processed) text
of the message to the Unix command, and sending the
raw (unprocessed) text of the message to the Unix command.
The default is to send the shown text.
The raw version of the message will contain all of the headers and any
MIME encoding that the message contains.
If you've selected the Raw Text then the prompt will have the additional word
&quot;RAW&quot; in it, like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe RAW messages to :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
You can experiment with this option by piping to something simple like the
Unix &quot;cat&quot; command.
   </DD>
   <DT>Captured Output or Free Output</DT>
   <DD>This option toggles between having Alpine capture the output of
the Unix pipe command for display, and not capturing it.
If the command you are piping to is a filter that will produce output
you want to view, then you want to capture that output
for display (the default).
If the Unix command doesn't produce output or handles the display itself,
then you want free output.
When you've selected the Free Output option the prompt will change to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe messages to (uncaptured) :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
   </DD>
   <DT>No Delimiter or With Delimiter</DT>
   <DD>This option controls whether or not a Unix mailbox style delimiter
will come before the text of the message.
This is the delimiter used in the common Unix mailbox format.
It's the single line that begins with the five characters
&quot;From&quot; followed by a &lt;SPACE&gt; character.
You'll usually only want to include this if the Unix command requires
input in the format of a traditional Unix mailbox file.
When you've selected the With Delimiter option the prompt will change to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe messages to (delimited) :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
   </DD>
   <DT>To Same Pipe or To Individual Pipes</DT>
   <DD>This option only shows up if you are running an aggregate
pipe command.
That is, the command was Apply Pipe, not just Pipe.
You have the option of piping all of the selected messages through a
single pipe to a single instance of the Unix command,
or piping each individual message through a separate pipe to separate
instances of the Unix command.
The default is that all of the output will go through a single pipe
to a single instance of the command.
You can try this option with a command like &quot;less&quot;, with Free
Output enabled.
When you've selected the Individual Pipes option the prompt will change to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe messages to (new pipe) :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
   </DD>
</DL>

<P>
As mentioned earlier, the options can be combined in any way you wish.
You may leave them all off, turn them all on, or turn some of them on
and some of them off.
If you use the pipe command a second time in the same session the default
options will be what you used the last time.

To define a folder outside the default area, prefix
the path with the namespace to use when interpreting the
given path.  If a namespace is specified, the folder name begins with the
sharp (#) character followed by the name of the namespace

<HEAD>
<TITLE>WHAT IS A MAIL DROP?</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>What is a Mail Drop?</H1>

In some situaions it may make sense to have your mail delivered to one
folder (the Mail Drop) and then when you want to read mail that has been
delivered to the Mail Drop folder Alpine will move it to another
destination folder.
Often the Mail Drop will be a remote folder and messages will be moved from
there to a local destination folder.

<P>
One example where this might make sense is if the Mail Drop folder is accessible
only with the POP protocol.
You could designate your POP inbox as the Mail Drop folder and have Alpine move
mail from there to a local (on the same machine Alpine is running on)
destination folder, where you'll read it.

<P>
A Mail Drop may only be used as your Inbox or as an
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;Incoming folder&quot;</A>.

<P>
There is no attempt to synchronize the contents of the destination folder
with the contents of the Mail Drop folder.
All that happens is that all of the messages in the Mail Drop folder are
copied to the destination folder and then they are deleted and expunged (if possible)
from the Mail Drop folder.
The next time a check for new mail is made, any messages in the Mail 
Drop folder are once again copied to the destination folder and deleted
and expunged from the Mail Drop folder.
(If the Mail Drop folder is a news group, then the messages can't be
expunged from the newsgroup. Instead, only Recent messages are copied from
the newsgroup to the destination folder.)

<P>
Configuration of a Mail Drop is a little different from configuration of
a folder that does not use a Mail Drop because you have to specify two
folder names instead of one.
The two folders may be any types of folders that Alpine can normally use.
They don't have to be a remote folder and a local folder, that is
simply the most common usage.
When you use a Mail Drop folder Alpine will periodically re-open the Mail
Drop to check for new mail.
The new-mail checks will happen at the frequency set with the
<A HREF="h_config_mailcheck"><!--#echo var="VAR_mail-check-interval"--></A> option,
but with a minimum time
(<A HREF="h_config_maildropcheck"><!--#echo var="VAR_maildrop-check-minimum"--></A>)
between checks.
Because of this minimum you may notice that new mail does not
appear promptly when you expect it.
The reason for this is to protect the server from over-zealous opening and
closing of the Mail Drop folder.
If the user initiates the check by typing ^L (Ctrl-L) or the Next command when at
the end of the folder index, then the check will happen, regardless of how
long it has been since the previous check.
<P>
If there is new mail, that mail will be copied to the destination folder
and then will be deleted from the Mail Drop.
Note that using a Mail Drop with a local destination folder does not make
sense if you read mail from more than one machine, because the mail is
downloaded to the destination folder (which is accessible from only one
machine) and deleted from the Mail Drop.
<P>
The feature <A HREF="h_config_maildrops_preserve_state"><!--#echo var="FEAT_maildrops-preserve-state"--></A> modifies the operation of Mail Drops.

<P>
The actual syntax used by Alpine for a folder that uses a Mail Drop is:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#move&lt;DELIM&gt;&lt;MailDropFolder&gt;&lt;DELIM&gt;&lt;DestinationFolder&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The brackets are not literal.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&lt;DELIM&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
is a single character that does not appear in the MailDropFolder name.
If the name doesn't contain spaces then it can be a space character.
The two folder names are full technical
<A HREF="h_valid_folder_names">folder names</A>
as used by Alpine.
Here are a couple examples to give you an idea what is being talked about:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#move&nbsp;{popserver.example.com/pop3}inbox&nbsp;localfolder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#move+{nntpserver.example.com/nntp}#news.comp.mail.pine+local&nbsp;folder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

A #move folder may only be used as an
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;Incoming folder&quot;</A> or
an Inbox.
When you are in the FOLDER LIST of Incoming Message Folders (after turning
on the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-incoming-folders"-->&quot;</A>
option)
the Add command has a subcommand &quot;Use Mail Drop&quot;
which may be helpful for defining the folder in your Alpine configuration.
The same is true when you edit the
<A HREF="h_config_inbox_path"><!--#echo var="VAR_inbox-path"--></A>
option in Setup/Config.
Each of these configuration methods will also create the DestinationFolder
if it doesn't already exist.
If you are having problems, make sure the DestinationFolder exists.

If the Ctrl-R subcommand is present that means you can decide to Delete or
not Delete the message you are saving after you save it.
The label on that key gives the action to switch to.
If it says Delete and you type Ctrl-R the label displayed will change to
No Delete and the source message will be deleted after the save. If it
says No Delete and you type Ctrl-R the label displayed will change to
Delete and the message will not be deleted.
You can control the default for the Delete parameter with the
configuration feature <!--#echo var="FEAT_save-will-not-delete"-->.
<P>
Similarly, if the Ctrl-W subcommand is present that means you can decide
to Preserve the order of the messages being saved or not.
If it is labeled Preserve Order and you type Ctrl-W, the resulting Saved messages
will be in the same order as you see them in the source folder now.
The opposite action (which is usually the default) is that you don't care
about the order.
The Saved messages may or may not be in the same order in the destination folder.
There may be a performance penalty for choosing to save the messages in order.
You can control the default for the Preserve Order parameter with the
configuration feature
<!--#echo var="FEAT_save-aggregates-copy-sequence"-->.

If you haven't disabled the Save Input History and you've already done a
Save earlier in this session then you may use the Up and Down arrows to retrieve

<H1>Folder Collections Explained</H1>


Those of you with simple mail configurations will just see a list of all the
folders you have when choosing FOLDER LIST from Alpine's MAIN MENU.  
The special folders for INBOX, sent mail and saved messages
will appear at the top of the list.  All others are in alphabetical order.
<P>
If you
or your system administrator have defined more than one collection or if
you have a collection (for newsgroups or email folders) defined on your 
system, then you will see the COLLECTION LIST screen first when choosing 
FOLDER LIST from Alpine's MAIN MENU.
<P>
<H2>Why have multiple folder collections?</H2>
<P>
For Alpine users who only maintain email folders (and not too many) on one host, 
a single folder collection is probably sufficient.<P>

However, people who have more than one email account - for example, one 
at their university, and one with their personal Internet Service Provider - 
will have different sets of folders on different hosts, and they may want to
access them all from the same installation of Alpine, rather than use different 
software and/or log into other hosts to manipulate messages in different 
accounts.  (If in doubt whether one of your email accounts can be accessed 
with Alpine, contact the technical support people for that account.)  Even people
who have only one email account on one host, but have dozens or
hundreds of email folders, may want to arrange these folders together in a 
meaningful way.<BR>
That is where multiple collections come in.

<H2>Types of Collections</H2>
<DL>
<DT>INCOMING FOLDERS</DT>
<DD>&quot;Incoming Message Folders&quot; 
is a special collection typically used to supplement your single INBOX.  
All the folders here are meant to be ones that receive incoming messages, 
which you intend to check more or less frequently.  
You may have multiple folders like this because you or your systems 
administrator have set up an external program or you may have set up
Alpine to filter incoming 
messages into different folders, based on certain criteria such as 
sender, recipient, or subject; or because you have multiple accounts and 
wish to check their INBOXes easily.  This collection is established by 
setting the 
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-incoming-folders"-->&quot;</A>
feature in the SETUP CONFIGURATION screen, which is accessed from the 
MAIN MENU.
</DD>

<DT>NEWS</DT>
<DD>You can also define a collection specifically for
newsgroups.  Alpine does this for you implicitly when you 
<A HREF="h_config_nntp_server">define an NNTP Server</A>
in your Alpine configuration.  The news collection appears last in the 
COLLECTION LIST (though you can shuffle it up in the order of presentation),
and Alpine knows not to save messages there.
</DD>

<DT>DEFAULT COLLECTION</DT>
<DD>This is the default collection for your saved and sent messages folders.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<H2>Defining Collections</H2>
<P>
In the absence of any folder-collection definitions, Alpine will assume a
single default folder collection.
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
<!--chtml else-->
If necessary, Alpine will create the directory
&quot;mail&quot; in your Unix home directory 
to hold your folders.
<!--chtml endif-->
<P>
You can use the 
<A HREF="h_collection_maint">Setup/collectionList screen</A>, called up from 
the MAIN MENU, to manage your collection list.

In order for this to be useful for selecting messages, the nicknames of

<H2>Description of the Select Priority Screen</H2>

This screen gives you a way to select a priority for the message you are sending.
This priority will be placed in the non-standard X-Priority header of your outgoing mail.
Some mail programs will display an indication of the priority level to
the recipient of the message, some will ignore it.
Even in cases where the mail programs of both the sender and the recipient
agree on the meaning of this header, keep in mind that it is
something that the sender sets so it is only an indication
of the priority that the sender attaches to the mail.
Alpine can be made to display an indication of this priority in incoming
messages by use of one of the tokens
(<A HREF="h_index_tokens">Tokens for Index and Replying</A>)
PRIORITY, PRIORITYALPHA, or PRIORITY! in the
<A HREF="h_config_index_format"><!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--></A> option.

<HEAD>
<TITLE>PATTERNS</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>PATTERNS</H1>
Patterns are used with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, Other Rules, and Search Rules.
Patterns are compared with a message to see if there is a match.
For Filtering, the messages being checked are all the messages in the
folder, one at a time.
For Index Line Coloring, each message that is visible on the screen is
checked for matches with the Index Coloring Patterns.
Roles are used with the Reply, Forward, and Compose commands.
For Reply, the message used to compare the Pattern with is the message
being replied to;
for Forward, the message used to compare the Pattern with is the message
being forwarded;
and for Compose, there is no message, so the parts of the Pattern that depend
on a message (everything other than Current Folder Type and the
Beginning of Month and Year)
are not used.
Only the Current Folder Type matters for Compose (plus the Beginning of
Month or Year, which you wouldn't usually use for a Role).
For Scoring, the message being scored is compared with all of the Score
Patterns, and the Score Values from the ones that match are added together to 
get the message's score.
For Other Rules, there is no message. Only the Current Folder Type is checked
for Other Rules.
<P>
Each Pattern has several possible parts, all of which are optional.
In order for there to be a match, <EM>ALL</EM> of the
<EM>defined</EM> parts of the Pattern must match the message.
If a part is not defined it is considered a match, but note that a filtering
Pattern must have at least one defined part or it will be ignored.
For example, if the To pattern is not defined it will be
displayed as
<P>
<CENTER>To pattern = &lt;No Value Set&gt;</CENTER>
<P>
That is considered a match because it is not defined.
This means that the Pattern with nothing defined is a match if the
Current Folder Type matches, but there is an exception that was mentioned
in the previous paragraph.
Because filtering is a potentially destructive action, filtering Patterns
with nothing other than Current Folder Type defined are ignored.
If you really want a filtering Pattern to match all messages (subject to
Current Folder Type) the best way to do it is to define a Score interval
that includes all possible scores.
This would be the score interval <SAMP>(-INF,INF)</SAMP>.
This can be used even if you haven't defined any rules to Set Scores.
<P>
There are six predefined header patterns called the To, From, Sender, Cc, News,
and Subject patterns.
Besides those six predefined header patterns, you may add
additional header patterns with header fieldnames of your choosing.
You add an extra header pattern by placing the cursor on one of the
patterns while in the role editor and using the &quot;eXtraHdr&quot; command.
The Recip pattern is a header pattern that stands for Recipient (To OR Cc)
and the Partic pattern is a header pattern that stands for
Participant (From OR To OR Cc).
(Defining the Recip pattern does not have the same effect as defining both
the To and Cc patterns. Recip is To <EM>OR</EM> Cc, not To <EM>AND</EM> Cc.)
Similar to the header patterns are the AllText pattern and the BodyText pattern.
Instead of comparing this pattern's text against only the contents of
a particular header field, the text for the AllText pattern is compared
with text anywhere in the message's header or body, and the text for the
BodyText pattern is compared with text anywhere in the message's body.
<P>
Any of the header patterns, the AllText pattern, or the BodyText pattern may be negated with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
You can tell that <EM>NOT</EM> has been turned on by looking for the character
&quot;!&quot; at the beginning of the pattern line.
When the &quot;!&quot; is present, it reverses the meaning of the match.
That is, if the pattern matches then it is considered to NOT be a match, and
if it does not match it is considered to be a match.
<P>
Don't make the mistake of putting the &quot;!&quot; in the data field for
a pattern.
For example, if you type the characters &quot;!urgent&quot; into the Subject
pattern, the pattern will look like:
<P>
<PRE>
 Subject pattern = !urgent
</PRE>
<P>
This means you want to match the 7 character sequence &quot;!urgent&quot;.
In order to match messages that do not have &quot;urgent&quot; in
their Subject field, first type the characters &quot;urgent&quot; followed
by carriage return for the value of the Subject pattern, then negate it
by typing the &quot;!&quot; command.
It should look like
<P>
<PRE>
 ! Subject pattern = urgent
</PRE>
<P>
The contents of each of these header patterns (or the AllText or BodyText patterns) may
be a complete email address, part of an address, or a random set of
characters to match against.
It may also be a list of such patterns, which means you
are looking for a match against the first pattern in the list <EM>OR</EM>
the second pattern <EM>OR</EM> the third and so on.
For example, a Subject pattern equal to
<P>
<PRE>
 Subject pattern = urgent
                   emergency
                   alert
</PRE>
<P>
would match all messages with a subject that contained at least one
of those words.
It would also match subjects containing the words &quot;alerts&quot; or
&quot;Urgently&quot;.
<P>
The same example with &quot;NOT&quot; turned on would be
<P>
<PRE>
 ! Subject pattern = urgent
                     emergency
                     alert
</PRE>
<P>
which would match all messages with a subject that did <EM>NOT</EM> contain any of
those words.
You can use the &quot;Add Value&quot; command to add new words to the list,
or you can enter them as a comma-separated list.
<P>
(It is not possible to specify two patterns that must <EM>BOTH</EM> be
present for a match.
It is only possible to specify that <EM>EITHER</EM> pattern1 <EM>OR</EM>
pattern2 must be present,
and that is exactly what using a list does.)
<P>
The &quot;Current Folder Type&quot; and the &quot;Score Interval&quot; are
also part of the Pattern, although the &quot;Score Interval&quot; is not used
when checking for matches for Scoring.
There are five similar settings that relate to the status of the message.
These settings rely on the message being New or not, Deleted or not,
Answered or not, Important or not, and Recent or not.
There are also some other miscellaneous settings.
The first is the Age of the message in days.
Another is the Size of the message, in bytes.
The third is a setting that detects whether or not the Subject of a
message contains raw 8-bit characters (unencoded characters with the most
significant bit set).
There is a setting that detects whether or not this is the first time
Alpine has been run this month (doesn't depend on individual messages),
and another that detects whether or not this is the first time Alpine has
been run this year.
Other parts of the Pattern detect whether or not the From address of a
message appears in your address book, whether or not certain keywords
are set for a message, and whether or not certain character sets are
used in a message.

<H2>Parts of a Pattern</H2>

<H3>Header patterns</H3>

A header pattern is simply text that is searched for in the corresponding
header field.
For example, if a Pattern has a From header pattern with the value
&quot;@company.com&quot;, then only messages that have a From header
that contains the text &quot;@company.com&quot; will be possible
matches.
Matches don't have to be exact.
For example, if the relevant field of a message contains the text
&quot;mailbox@domain&quot; somewhere
in it, then header patterns of &quot;box&quot;, or &quot;x@d&quot;, or
&quot;mailbox@domain&quot; are all matches.
<P>
All parts of the Pattern must match so, for example,
if a message matches a defined
From pattern, it still must be checked against the other parts of the
Pattern that have been defined.
The To header pattern is a slightly special case.
If the message being checked has a Resent-To header
and the feature <A HREF="h_config_use_resentto"><!--#echo var="FEAT_use-resent-to-in-rules"--></A> is turned on, the addresses
there are used in place of the addresses in the To header.
This is only true for the To header.
Resent-cc and Resent-From headers are never used unless you add them
with the eXtraHdrs command.
<P>
The meaning of a header pattern may be negated with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
You can tell that <EM>NOT</EM> has been turned on by looking for the character
&quot;!&quot; at the beginning of the pattern line.
It would look something like
<P>
<PRE>
 ! From pattern = susan@example.com
</PRE>
<P>
When the &quot;!&quot; is present, it reverses the meaning of the match.
<P>
If you want to check for the presence of a header field but don't care
about its value, then
the empty pattern that you get by entering a pair of
double quotes (&quot;&quot;) should match any message that
has the corresponding header field.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_alltext">AllText patterns</A></H3>

AllText patterns are just like header patterns except that the text is
searched for anywhere in the message's headers or body, not just in the
contents of a particular header field.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="pattern_bodytext">BodyText patterns</A></H3>

BodyText patterns are just like header patterns except that the text is
searched for anywhere in the message's body, not just in the
contents of a particular header field.
<P>

If there is more than one header pattern or AllText pattern or BodyText pattern
for which you want to take the
same action there is a shorthand notation that may be used.
Any of these patterns may be a list of patterns instead of
just a single pattern.
If any one of the patterns in the list matches the message
then it is considered a match.
For example, if &quot;company1&quot; and &quot;company2&quot; both required
you to use the same role when replying to messages, you might have
a To pattern that looks like
<P>
<PRE>
 To pattern = company1.com
              company2.com
</PRE>
<P>
This means that if the mail you are replying to was addressed to
either &quot;anything@company1.com&quot; or &quot;anything@company2.com&quot;,
then this Pattern is a match and the same actions will be taken.
<P>
The meaning of an AllText or BodyText pattern may be negated with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
You can tell that <EM>NOT</EM> has been turned on by looking for the character
&quot;!&quot; at the beginning of the pattern line.
When the &quot;!&quot; is present, it reverses the meaning of the match.
<P>
A technicality: Since comma is the character used to separate multiple values
in any of the fields that may have multiple values (such as header patterns,
AllText patterns, BodyText patterns, keywords, folder lists, and so on),
you must escape comma with a
backslash (&#92;) if you want to include a literal comma in one of those fields.
In other words, if you type a backslash followed by a comma it will
be interpreted as a comma by Alpine, instead of as a separator between
pattern values.
All other backslashes (those not followed by a comma) are literal
backslashes and should not be escaped.
It's unlikely you'll ever need to enter a literal comma or backslash in
any of the patterns.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_current_folder">Current Folder Type</A></H3>

The &quot;Current Folder Type&quot; may be set to one of four different
values: &quot;Any&quot;, &quot;News&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;, or
&quot;Specific&quot;.
If the value is set to &quot;News&quot;, then the
Pattern will only match if the currently open folder is a newsgroup.
The value &quot;Email&quot; only matches if the current folder is not news and
the value &quot;Any&quot; causes any folder to match.
If the value of &quot;Current Folder Type&quot; is set to &quot;Specific&quot;,
then you must fill in a value for &quot;Folder&quot;, which is on the line
below the &quot;Specific&quot; line.
In this case you will only get a match if the currently open folder is
the specific folder you list.
You may give a list of folders instead of just a single
folder name, in which case the Pattern will match if the open folder is
any one of the folders in the list.
The name of each folder in the list may be either &quot;INBOX&quot;,
the technical specification
of the folder (like what appears in your configuration file) or, if the
folder is one of your incoming folders, it may be the nickname you've given
the folder.
Here are some samples of specific folder names:

<CENTER><SAMP>{monet.art.example.com}mail/art-class</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{news.example.com/nntp}#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>mail/local-folder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The easiest way to fill in the &quot;Folder&quot; field is to use
the &quot;T&quot; command that is available when the &quot;Folder&quot; line is
highlighted, or to use the &quot;Take&quot; command with the configuration
feature
<A HREF="h_config_enable_role_take">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-rules-under-take"-->&quot;</A>
turned on.
<P>
When reading a newsgroup, there may be a performance penalty
incurred when collecting the information necessary to check whether
or not a Pattern matches a message.
For this reason, the default Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Email&quot;.
If you have Patterns with a Current Folder Type of either
&quot;Any&quot; or &quot;News&quot; and those Patterns are used for
Index Line Coloring or Scoring, you may experience
slower screen redrawing in the MESSAGE INDEX screen when in a newsgroup.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_age_interval">Age Interval</A></H3>

The &quot;Age Interval&quot; may be set to an interval of message
ages that should be considered a match.
Like the other parts of the Pattern, if it is unset it will be ignored.
The Age Interval looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_age,max_age)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_age&quot; and &quot;max_age&quot; are integers greater
than or equal to zero.
The special value &quot;INF&quot; may be used for
the max value. It represents infinity.
<P>
Actually, this option may be defined as a list of intervals instead
of just a single interval.
The list is separated by commas.
It can look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_age1,max_age1),(min_age2,max_age2),...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
When there is an Age Interval defined, it is a match if the age, in days, of
the message is contained in any of the intervals.
The intervals include both endpoints.
<P>
Even though this option is called Age, it isn't actually
the <EM>age</EM> of the message.
Instead, it is how many days ago the message arrived in one of your folders.
If the current time is a little past midnight, then a message that arrived
just before midnight arrived yesterday, even though the message is only
a few minutes old.
By default, the date being used is not the date in the Date
header of the message.
It is the date that the message arrived in one of your folders.
When you Save a message from one folder to another that arrival date
is preserved.
If you would like to use the date in the Date header that is possible.
Turn on the option
<A HREF="h_config_filt_opts_sentdate">&quot;Use-Date-Header-For-Age&quot;</A>
near the bottom of the rule definition.
A value of 0 is today, 1 is yesterday, 2 is the day before yesterday, and so on.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_size_interval">Size Interval</A></H3>

The &quot;Size Interval&quot; may be set to an interval of message
sizes that should be considered a match.
Like the other parts of the Pattern, if it is unset it will be ignored.
The Size Interval looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_size,max_size)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_size&quot; and &quot;max_size&quot; are integers greater
than or equal to zero.
The special value &quot;INF&quot; may be used for
the max value. It represents infinity.
<P>
Actually, this option may be defined as a list of intervals instead
of just a single interval.
The list is separated by commas.
It can look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_size1,max_size1),(min_size2,max_size2),...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
When there is a Size Interval defined, it is a match if the size, in bytes, of
the message is contained in any of the intervals.
The intervals include both endpoints.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_score_interval">Score Interval</A></H3>

The &quot;Score Interval&quot; may be set to an interval of message
scores that should be considered a match.
Like the other parts of the Pattern, if it is unset it will be ignored.
The Score Interval looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_score,max_score)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_score&quot; and &quot;max_score&quot; are positive or
negative integers, with min_score less than or equal to max_score.
The special values &quot;-INF&quot; and &quot;INF&quot; may be used for
the min and max values to represent negative and positive infinity.
<P>
Actually, a list of intervals may be used if you wish.
A list would look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_score1,max_score1),(min_score2,max_score2),...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
When there is a Score Interval defined, it is a match if the score for
the message is contained in any of the intervals in the list.
The intervals include the endpoints.
The score for a message is calculated by looking at every Score rule defined and
adding up the Score Values for the ones that match the message.
When deciding whether or not a Pattern matches a message for purposes of
calculating the score, the Score Interval is ignored.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_message_status">Message Status</A></H3>

There are five separate message status settings.
By default, all five are set to the value &quot;Don't care&quot;, which
will match any message.
The value &quot;Yes&quot; means that the particular status must be true
for a match, and the value &quot;No&quot; means that the particular
status must not be true for a match.
For example, one of the five Message Status settings is whether a message
is marked Important or not.
A &quot;Yes&quot; means that the message must be Important to be
considered a match and &quot;No&quot; means that the message must not be
Important to be considered a match.
The same is true of the other four message status settings that depend
on whether or not the message is New; whether the message has 
been Answered or not; whether the message has been Deleted or not, and
whether the message is Recent or not. 
<P>
The nomenclature for New and Recent is a bit confusing:
<P>
New means that the message is Unseen.
It could have been in your mailbox for a long time but if you haven't looked
at it, it is still considered New.
That matches the default Alpine index display that shows an N for such a
message.
<P>
Recent means that the message was added to this folder since the last time
you opened the folder.
Alpine also shows an N by default for these types of messages.
If you were to run two copies of Alpine that opened a folder one right after
the other, a message would only show up as Recent in (at most) the first
Alpine session.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_message_keywords">Message Keywords</A></H3>

Keywords are similar to Message Status, but they are chosen by the user.
Provided the mail server allows for it, you may add a set of possible keywords
to a folder and then you may set those keywords or not for each message
in the folder (see <A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag Command</A>).
The syntax of this part of the Pattern is similar to the header patterns.
It is a list of keywords.
The Keyword part of the Pattern is a match if the message has any of
the keywords in the list set.
Like other parts of the Pattern, if this is unset it will be ignored.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_message_charsets">Message Character Sets</A></H3>

A message may use one or more character sets.
This part of the Pattern matches messages that make use of one or more of
the character sets specified in the pattern.
It will be considered a match if a message uses any of the character
sets in the list you give here.

<P>
Besides actual character set names (for example, ISO-8859-7, KOI8-R, or
GB2312) you may also use some shorthand names that Alpine provides.
These names are more understandable shorthand names for sets of 
character set names.
Two examples are &quot;Cyrillic&quot; and &quot;Greek&quot;.
Selecting one of these shorthand names is equivalent to selecting all of
the character sets that make up the set.
You can see all of these shorthand names and the lists of character sets
they stand for by typing the &quot;T&quot; command with the Character
Set pattern highlighted.
The syntax of this part of the Pattern is similar to the header patterns
and the Message Keywords pattern.
It is a list of character sets (or shorthand names).
The Character Set part of the Pattern is a match if the message uses any
of the character sets in the list.
Like other parts of the Pattern, if this is unset it will be ignored.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_8bit_subject">Raw 8-bit in Subject</A></H3>

It seems that lots of unwanted email contains unencoded 8-bit characters
in the Subject.
Normally, characters with the 8th bit set are not allowed in the Subject
header unless they are MIME-encoded.
This option gives you a way to match messages that have Subjects that
contain unencoded 8-bit characters.
By default, the value of this option is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which
will match any message.
The value &quot;Yes&quot; means that there must be raw 8-bit characters in
the Subject of the message in order for there to be a match,
and the value &quot;No&quot; is the opposite.
Setting this option will affect performance in large folders because the
subject of each message in the folder has to be checked.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_bom">Beginning of Month</A></H3>

This option gives you a way to take some action once per month.
By default, the value of this option is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which
will always match.
The value &quot;Yes&quot; means that this must be the first time Alpine has
been run this month in order to count as a match,
and the value &quot;No&quot; is the opposite.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_boy">Beginning of Year</A></H3>

This option gives you a way to take some action once per year.
By default, the value of this option is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which
will always match.
The value &quot;Yes&quot; means that this must be the first time Alpine has
been run this year in order to count as a match,
and the value &quot;No&quot; is the opposite.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_abookfrom">Address in Address Books</A></H3>

This option gives you a way to match messages that have an address
that is in one of your address books.
Only the simple entries in your address books are searched.
Address book distribution lists are ignored!
By default, the value of this option is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which
will match any message.
The value &quot;Yes, in any address book&quot; means the address
from the message must be in at least one of your
address books in order to be a match.
The value &quot;No, not in any address book&quot;
means none of the addresses may
be in any of your address books in order to be a match.
The values &quot;Yes, in specific address books&quot; and
&quot;No, not in any of specific address books&quot; are similar but instead
of depending on all address books you are allowed to give a list of address
books to look in.
The addresses from the message that are checked for are determined by the
setting you have for &quot;Types of addresses to check for in address book&quot;.
If you set this to &quot;From&quot; the From address from the message will
be looked up in the address book.
If you set it to only &quot;To&quot; then the To addresses will be used.
If any of the To addresses are in the address book then it is considered
a match for &quot;Yes&quot; or not a match for &quot;No&quot;.
You could set it to both From and To, in which case all of the From and To
addresses are used.
The &quot;Reply-To&quot; and &quot;Sender&quot; cases are a little unusual.
Due to deficiencies in our tools, Reply-To uses the Reply-To address if it
exists or the From address if there is no Reply-To address.
Same for the Sender address.
Setting this option may affect performance in large folders because the
From and Reply-To of each message in the folder have to be checked.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_categorizer">Categorizer Command</A></H3>

This is a command that is run with its standard input set to the message
being checked and its standard output discarded.
The full directory path should be specified.
The command will be run and then its exit status will be checked against
the Exit Status Interval, which defaults to just the value zero.
If the exit status of the command falls in the interval, it is considered
a match, otherwise it is not a match.
<P>

This option may actually be a list of commands.
The first one that exists and is executable is used.
That makes it possible to use the same configuration with Unix Alpine and
PC-Alpine.
<P>

If none of the commands in the list exists and is executable then the rule
is <EM>not</EM> a match.
If it is possible that the command may not exist, you should be careful
to structure your rules so that nothing destructive
happens when the command does not exist.
For example, you might have a filter that filters away spam when there is
a match but does nothing when there is not a match.
That would continue to work correctly if the command didn't exist.
However, if you have a filter that filters away spam when there is not
a match and keeps it when there is a match, that would filter everything
if the categorizer command didn't exist.
<P>
Here is an <A HREF="h_config_role_cat_cmd_example">example</A>
setup for the bogofilter filter.

<H2>Description of the Setup Roles Screen</H2>

This screen lets you add, delete, modify, or change the order of the rules
that determine the role you are playing when composing a message.
<P>
You may play different roles depending on who you are replying to.
For example, if you are replying to a message addressed to help-desk you
may be acting as a Help Desk Worker.
That role may require that you use a different return address and/or
a different signature.
<P>
Roles are optional.
If you set up roles they work like this:  Each role has a set of
&quot;Uses&quot;, which indicate whether or not a role is eligible to be
considered for a particular use; a &quot;Pattern&quot;,
which is used to decide which of the eligible roles is used; and a set
of &quot;Actions&quot;, which are taken when that role is used.
When you reply to a message, the message you are replying to is compared
with the Patterns of the roles marked as eligible for use when replying.
The comparisons start with the first eligible role and keep going until there
is a match.
If a match is found, the matching role's Actions are taken.
<P>
It is also possible to set a default role and to change that role during
your Alpine session.
When you start Alpine no default role will be set.
You may set or change the current default role by using the &quot;D&quot;
command in the role selection screen.
You'll see that screen while composing a message and being asked to select
a role.
An easy way to get to that screen is to use the <A HREF="h_common_role">Role Command</A> to
compose a message.
You may find a default role useful if you normally perform the duties of one
of your roles for a while, then you switch to another role and stay in the
new role for another period of time.
It may be easier than using the Role Command to select the role each time you
compose a message.

<H2>Role Uses</H2>

There are three types of use to be configured;
one for Replying, one for Forwarding, and one for Composing.
These indicate whether or not you want a role to be considered when you
type the Reply, Forward, or Compose commands.
(The Role command is an alternate form of the Compose command, and it is
not affected by these settings.)
Each of these Use types has three possible values.
The value &quot;Never&quot;
means that the role will never be considered as a candidate for use with
the corresponding command.
For example, if you set a role's Reply Use to Never, then when you Reply to
a message, that role won't even be considered.
(That isn't quite true. If the message you are replying to matches some other
role that requires confirmation,
then there will be a ^T command available which allows you to select a role
from all of your roles, not just the reply-eligible roles.)
<P>

The options &quot;With confirmation&quot; and &quot;Without confirmation&quot;
both mean that you do want to consider this role when using the corresponding
command.
For either of these settings the role's Pattern will
be checked to see if it matches the message.
For Reply Use, the message used to compare the Pattern with is the message
being replied to.
For Forward Use, the message used to compare the Pattern with is the message
being forwarded.
For Compose Use, there is no message, so the parts of the Pattern that depend
on a message (everything other than Current Folder Type) are ignored.
In all cases, the Current Folder Type is checked if defined.
If there is a match then this role will either be used without confirmation
or will be the default when confirmation is asked for, depending on
which of the two options is selected.
If confirmation is requested, you will have a chance to
choose No Role instead of the offered role, or to
change the role to any one of your other roles (with the ^T command).

<H2>Role Patterns</H2>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches a role the message is
compared with the Role's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, Other Rules, and Search Rules, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;.
<P>
Since header patterns, AllText patterns, and BodyText patterns that are unset are ignored,
a role that has all header patterns unset, the AllText pattern unset,
the BodyText pattern unset,
the Score Interval unset, and the Current Folder Type set to
&quot;Any&quot; may be used as a default role.
It should be put last in the list of roles since the matching
starts at the beginning and proceeds until one of the roles is a match.
If no roles at all match, then Alpine will
use its regular methods of defining the role.
If you wanted to, you could define a different &quot;default&quot; role
for Replying, Forwarding, and Composing by setting the
&quot;Use&quot; fields appropriately.

<H2>Role Actions</H2>

Once a role match is found, the role's Actions are taken.
For each role there are several possible actions that may be defined.
They are actions to set the From address, the Reply-To address,
the Fcc, the Signature, the Template file, and Other Headers.

<H3>Set From</H3>

The From address is the address used on the From line of the message
you are sending.

<H3>Set Reply-To</H3>

The Reply-To address is the address used on the Reply-To line of the message
you are sending.
You don't need a Reply-To address unless it is different from the From address.

<H3>Set Other Headers</H3>

If you want to set the value of the From or Reply-To headers, use
the specific fields &quot;Set From&quot; or &quot;Set Reply-To&quot;.
If you want to set the values of other headers, use this field.
This field is similar to the
<A HREF="h_config_custom_hdrs"><!--#echo var="VAR_customized-hdrs"--></A> configuration option.
Each header you specify here must include the header tag
(&quot;To:&quot;, &quot;Approved:&quot;, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.
It is different from the <!--#echo var="VAR_customized-hdrs"--> in that the value you give
for a header here will replace any value that already exists.
For example, if you are Replying to a message there will be at least one
address in the To header (the address you are Replying to).
However, if you Reply using a role that sets the To header, that role's
To header value will be used instead.

<H3>Set Fcc</H3>

The Fcc is used as the Fcc for the message you are sending.

<H3>Set Signature or Set LiteralSig</H3>

The Signature is the name of a file to be used as the signature file when
this role is being used.
If the name of the file has a vertical bar following it (|)
then it is assumed that the file is a program that should be run to
produce the signature.
If the LiteralSig is set, then it is used instead of the signature file.
LiteralSig is just a different way to store the signature.
It is stored in the pine configuration file instead of in a separate
signature file.
If the <A HREF="h_config_literal_sig"><!--#echo var="VAR_literal-signature"--></A> option is defined
either in the role or as the default signature in the Setup/Config screen,
then the signature file is ignored.

<H3>Set Template</H3>

A Template is the name of a file to be included in the message when this
role is being used.
If the name of the file has a vertical bar following it (|)
then it is assumed that the file is a program that should be run to
produce the template.

<P>
Both signature files and template files may be stored remotely on an IMAP
server.
In order to do that you just give the file a remote name.
This works just like the regular
<A HREF="h_config_signature_file"><!--#echo var="VAR_signature-file"--></A>
option that is configured from the Setup/Configuration screen.
A remote signature file name might look like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us}mail/sig3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Once you have named the remote signature or template file you create its
contents by using the &quot;F&quot; &quot;editFile&quot; command when the
cursor is on the &quot;Set Signature&quot; or &quot;Set Template&quot;
line of the role editor.

<P>
Both signature files and template files (or the output of signature programs
and template file programs) may contain special tokens
that are replaced with contents
that depend on the message being replied to or forwarded.
See the help for the individual fields inside the role editor for more
information on tokens.

<H3>Use SMTP Server</H3>

If this field has a value, then it will be used as the SMTP server
to send mail when this role is being used (unless the SMTP server variable
is set in the system-wide fixed configuration file).
It has the same semantics as the
<A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_smtp-server"-->&quot;</A>
variable in the Setup/Config screen.
When you postpone the composition this SMTP server list will be saved
with the postponed composition and it cannot be changed later.
Because of that, you may want to make this a list of SMTP servers
with the preferred server at the front of the list and alternate servers
later in the list.

<P>
If any of the actions are left unset, then the action depends on what
is present in the &quot;Initialize settings using role&quot; field.
If you've listed the nickname of another one of your roles there, then the
corresponding action from that role will be used here.
If that action is also blank, or if there is no nickname specified,
then Alpine will do whatever it normally does to set these actions.
This depends on other configuration options and features you've set.

<H2>Command Descriptions</H2>

<H3>Add</H3>

The Add command is used to add a new role definition to your set of
roles.
The new role will be added after the highlighted role.

<H3>Delete</H3>

The Delete command deletes the currently highlighted role.

<H3>Change</H3>

The Change command lets you edit the nickname, Uses, Pattern,
and Actions of the currently highlighted role.

<H3>Shuffle</H3>

The Shuffle command allows you to change the order of the roles.
You may move the currently highlighted role up or down in the list.
The order of the roles is important since the roles are tested for a
match starting with the first role and continuing until a match is found.
You should place the roles with more specific Patterns near the beginning
of the list, and those with more general Patterns near the end so that
the more specific matches will happen when appropriate.

<H3>Replicate</H3>

The Replicate command is used to copy an existing role and modify it.
The new role will be added after the highlighted role.

<H3>IncludeFile</H3>

The IncludeFile command allows you to add a roles file to your configuration.
Usually, your roles will be contained in your Alpine configuration file.
If you wish, some or all of your roles may be stored in a separate file.
If a roles file already exists (maybe it was made by somebody else using
Alpine), you may insert it before the currently highlighted role.
You may also insert an empty file or a file that does not yet exist.
Once you have an empty roles file in your configuration, you may use
the Shuffle command to move roles into it.
In fact, that's the only way to get the initial role into the file.

<H3>eXcludeFile</H3>

The eXcludeFile command removes a roles file from your roles configuration.
A limitation of the program is that in order to exclude a roles file
that file must have at least one role
in it, otherwise you won't be able to highlight a line in the file.
So you may have to add a dummy role to the file in order to exclude the file.

</PRE>
<!--chtml endif-->

<H2>Description of the Setup Other Rules Screen</H2>

This is where you may set various actions that do not fit well into the
other Rules categories.

<H2>Patterns</H2>

Other Rules are a little different from the rest of the Rules because
they depend only on the current folder, and not on a particular message.
In order to determine whether or not a rule's actions should be applied
the current folder is compared with the rule's Pattern, which consists
of only the Current Folder Type.
Current Folder Type works the same for Other Rules as it does for Roles,
Filtering, Index Coloring, and Scoring.
Keep in mind that the only part of the Pattern that applies to Other
Rules is the Current Folder Type when looking at the description of
Patterns given
&quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;.

<H2>The Actions</H2>

<H3>Set Sort Order</H3>

When you enter a new folder, these rules will be checked to see if you
have set a sort order that is different from your default sort order.
The default is set in the Setup/Config screen with
the &quot;<A HREF="h_config_sort_key"><!--#echo var="VAR_sort-key"--></A>&quot; option.
If the Sort Order action is set, then the folder will be displayed sorted in
that sort order instead of in the default order.
<P>
A possible point of confusion arises when you change the configuration
of the Sort Order for the currently open folder.
The folder will normally be re-sorted when you go back to viewing the
index.
However, if you have manually sorted the folder with the
Sort
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F7<!--chtml else-->$<!--chtml endif-->)
command, then it will not be re-sorted until the next time it is opened.

<H3>Set Index Format</H3>

When you enter a new folder, these rules will be checked to see if you
have set an Index Format that is different from your default Index Format,
which is set with the
<A HREF="h_config_index_format">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"-->&quot;</A> option.
If so, the index will be displayed with this format instead of the default.

<H3>Set Startup Rule</H3>

When you enter a new folder, these rules will be checked to see if you
have set a startup rule that is different from the default startup rule.
The default for incoming folders is set in the Setup/Config screen with
the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_incoming-startup-rule"-->&quot; option.
The default for folders other than INBOX that are not part of your
incoming collection
(see <A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming"><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-incoming-folders"--></A> feature) 
is to start with the last message in the folder.
If the Startup Rule is set to something other than &quot;default&quot;,
then the rule will determine which message will be the current message when
the folder is first opened.
<P>
The various startup rule possibilities work the same here as they do in
the incoming collection, so check
<A HREF="h_config_inc_startup"><!--#echo var="VAR_incoming-startup-rule"--></A>
for more help.

<H2>Command Descriptions</H2>

<H3>Add</H3>

The Add command is used to add a new rule definition to your set of
rules.
The new rule will be added after the highlighted rule.

<H3>Delete</H3>

The Delete command deletes the currently highlighted rule.

<H3>Change</H3>

The Change command lets you edit the nickname, Pattern,
and Action of the currently highlighted rule.

<H3>Shuffle</H3>

The Shuffle command allows you to change the order of the rules.
You may move the currently highlighted rule up or down in the list.
The order of the rules is important since the rules are tested for a
match starting with the first rule and continuing until a match is found.
You should place the rules with more specific Patterns near the beginning
of the list, and those with more general Patterns near the end so that
the more specific matches will happen when appropriate.

<H3>Replicate</H3>

The Replicate command is used to copy an existing rule definition and modify it.
The new rule will be added after the highlighted rule.

<H3>IncludeFile</H3>

The IncludeFile command allows you to add a rules file to your configuration.
Usually, your rules will be contained in your Alpine configuration file.
If you wish, some or all of your rules may be stored in a separate file.
If a rules file already exists (maybe it was made by somebody else using
Alpine), you may insert it before the currently highlighted rule.
You may also insert an empty file or a file that does not yet exist.
Once you have an empty rules file in your configuration, you may use
the Shuffle command to move rules into it.
In fact, that's the only way to get the initial rule into the file.

<H3>eXcludeFile</H3>

The eXcludeFile command removes a rules file from your rules configuration.
A limitation of the program is that in order to exclude a rules file
that file must have at least one rule
in it, otherwise you won't be able to highlight a line in the file.
So you may have to add a dummy rule to the file in order to exclude the file.

<H2>Description of the Setup Search Rules Screen</H2>

One of the commands that becomes available when that feature is turned on
is the &quot;; Select&quot; command, which is used in the MESSAGE INDEX
screen to select a set of messages.
One way of selecting messages is to use a Rule.
All of the messages that match (or don't match if you wish)
a Rule's Pattern will be selected.
<P>
Any of your Rules may be used for this purpose.
You might already have Rules set up for filtering, index line color, scores, or roles;
and you may use any of those Rules with the Select command.
However, you might find it more convenient to set up a separate set of Rules
just for this purpose without having to worry about what other effects
they may cause.
That is the purpose of these Select Rules.

<P>
Each rule has a &quot;Pattern&quot;
that is used to decide which messages are selected when you use it with
the Select command.

<H2>Patterns</H2>

In order to determine whether or not a message should be selected
the message is compared with the rule's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, Other Rules, and Search Rules, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;.

<H2>Command Descriptions</H2>

<H3>Add</H3>

The Add command is used to add a new rule definition to your set of
rules.
The new rule will be added after the highlighted rule.

<H3>Delete</H3>

The Delete command deletes the currently highlighted rule.

<H3>Change</H3>

The Change command lets you edit the nickname and Pattern
of the currently highlighted rule.

<H3>Shuffle</H3>

The Shuffle command allows you to change the order of the rules.
This affects only the order they are presented in when you use the
^T subcommand of the Select by Rule command.
You may move the currently highlighted rule up or down in the list.

<H3>Replicate</H3>

The Replicate command is used to copy an existing rule definition and modify it.
The new rule will be added after the highlighted rule.

<H3>IncludeFile</H3>

The IncludeFile command allows you to add a rules file to your configuration.
Usually, your rules will be contained in your Alpine configuration file.
If you wish, some or all of your rules may be stored in a separate file.
If a rules file already exists (maybe it was made by somebody else using
Alpine), you may insert it before the currently highlighted rule.
You may also insert an empty file or a file that does not yet exist.
Once you have an empty rules file in your configuration, you may use
the Shuffle command to move rules into it.
In fact, that's the only way to get the initial rule into the file.

<H3>eXcludeFile</H3>

The eXcludeFile command removes a rules file from your rules configuration.
A limitation of the program is that in order to exclude a rules file
that file must have at least one rule
in it, otherwise you won't be able to highlight a line in the file.
So you may have to add a dummy rule to the file in order to exclude the file.

<H2>Description of the Setup Index Line Colors Screen</H2>

Index Line Color causes lines in the MESSAGE INDEX screen to be colored.
This action is only available if your terminal is capable of displaying
color and color display has been enabled with the
<A HREF="h_config_color_style">Color Style</A> option within the
Setup Color screen.
(In PC-Alpine, color is always enabled so there is no option to turn on.)
This screen lets you add, delete, modify, or change the order of the rules
that cause the lines in the MESSAGE INDEX to be displayed in different
colors.
<P>
Each rule has a &quot;Pattern&quot;,
which is used to decide which of the rules is used; and the color that
is used if the Pattern matches a particular message.

<H2>Index Color Patterns</H2>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches an Index Color Rule
the message is compared with the rule's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, Other Rules, and Search Rules, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;.

<P>
If none of the Index Color rules is a match for a particular index line,
then the color used is set using
the <A HREF="h_color_setup">Setup Kolor</A> screen.

<H2>Index Line Color</H2>

This is the color that index lines are colored when there is a matching
Pattern.
This colors the whole index line, except possibly the status letters,
which may be colored separately using
the <A HREF="h_color_setup">Setup Kolor</A> screen.

<H2>Command Descriptions</H2>

<H3>Add</H3>

The Add command is used to add a new rule definition to your set of

<H2>Description of the Setup Filtering Screen</H2>

This screen lets you add, delete, modify, or change the order of the rules
that determine the filtering Alpine does on folders you view.
<P>
The software that actually delivers mail (the stuff that happens
before Alpine is involved) for you is in a better position to do mail filtering
than Alpine itself.
If possible, you may want to look into using that sort of mail filtering to
deliver mail to different folders, delete it, or forward it.
However, if you'd like Alpine to help with this, Alpine's filtering is for you.
<P>
Filtering is a way to automatically move certain messages from one folder
to another or to delete messages.
It can also be used to set message status (Important, Deleted, New,
Answered) and to set <A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A> for messages.
Alpine doesn't have the ability to forward mail to another address or
to deliver vacation messages.
<P>
Each filtering rule has a &quot;Pattern&quot; and a &quot;Filter Action&quot;.
When a folder is opened, when new mail arrives in an open folder, or
when mail is Expunged from a folder; each
message is compared with the Patterns of your filtering rules.
The comparisons start with the first rule and keep going until there
is a match.
If a match is found, the message may be deleted or moved, depending on
the setting of the Filter Action.
If the message is not deleted, it may have its status altered.

<P>
<EM>NOTE:</EM>
When setting up a Pattern used to delete messages,
it is recommended that you test the Pattern first with a &quot;Move&quot;
folder specified in
case unintended matches occur.  Messages that are deleted will be removed 
from the folder and <EM>unrecoverable</EM> from within Alpine after the
next Expunge command or once the folder being filtered has been closed.

<H2>Filter Patterns</H2>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches a filter the message is
compared with the Filter's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, Other Rules, and Search Rules, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;.
<P>
Since filtering is a potentially destructive action, if you have a filtering
Pattern with nothing other than Current Folder Type set, that filtering
rule is ignored.

<H2>Filter Actions</H2>

Once a filter match is found for a particular message, there are some actions
that may be taken.
First, the message may have its status changed.
This is the same message status that you can manipulate manually using the
<a href="h_common_flag">Flag Command</a>.
There are always four elements of message status that you can control.
You can set or clear the Important status, the New status, the Deleted
status, and the Answered status.
Of course, if the filter is going to delete the message,
then there is no point in setting message status.
You may also be able to set user-defined keywords for a message.
Read a little about keywords in the help text for the
<A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag</A> command.
<P>
Second, the filter may delete or move the message.
Deleting the message marks it Deleted and removes it from view.
It is effectively gone forever (though it technically is still there until
the next expunge command, which may happen implicitly).
Moving the message moves it from the open folder into the folder
listed on the &quot;Folder List&quot; line of the filter configuration.
If you list more than one folder name (separated by commas) then the message
will be copied to each of those folders.
In any case, if &quot;Delete&quot; or &quot;Move&quot; is set then the
message is removed from the current folder.
If you just want to set the messages status without deleting it from
the folder, then set the filter action to
&quot;Just Set Message Status&quot;.
<P>
(There is no way to do a Copy instead of a Move, due to the difficulties
involved in keeping track of whether or not a message has
already been copied.)

<H2>Command Descriptions</H2>

<H3>Add</H3>

The Add command is used to add a new filter definition to your set of
filters.
The new filter will be added after the highlighted filter.

<H3>Delete</H3>

The Delete command deletes the currently highlighted filter.

<H3>Change</H3>

The Change command lets you edit the nickname, Pattern,
and Folder of the currently highlighted filter.

<H3>Shuffle</H3>

The Shuffle command allows you to change the order of the filters.
You may move the currently highlighted filter up or down in the list.
The order of the filters is important since the filters are tested for a
match starting with the first filter and continuing until a match is found.
You should place the filters with more specific Patterns near the beginning
of the list, and those with more general Patterns near the end so that
the more specific matches will happen when appropriate.

<H3>Replicate</H3>

The Replicate command is used to copy an existing filter and modify it.
The new filter will be added after the highlighted filter.

<H3>IncludeFile</H3>

The IncludeFile command allows you to add a filters file to your configuration.
Usually, your filters will be contained in your Alpine configuration file.
If you wish, some or all of your filters may be stored in a separate file.
If a filters file already exists (maybe it was made by somebody else using
Alpine), you may insert it before the currently highlighted filter.
You may also insert an empty file or a file that does not yet exist.
Once you have an empty filters file in your configuration, you may use
the Shuffle command to move filters into it.
In fact, that's the only way to get the initial filter into the file.

<H3>eXcludeFile</H3>

The eXcludeFile command removes a filters file from your filters configuration.
A limitation of the program is that in order to exclude a filters file
that file must have at least one filter
in it, otherwise you won't be able to highlight a line in the file.
So you may have to add a dummy filter to the file in order to exclude the file.

<H2>Description of the Setup Scoring Screen</H2>

Most people will not use scores at all, but if you do use them, here's how
they work in Alpine.
Using this screen, you may define Scoring rules.
The score for a message is calculated by looking at every Score rule defined
and adding up the Score Values for the ones that match the message.
If there are no matches for a message, it has a score of zero.
Message scores may be used a couple of ways in Alpine.

<H3>Sorting by Score</H3>

One of the methods you may use to sort message indexes is to sort by
score.
The scores of all the messages in a folder will be calculated and then
the index will be ordered by placing the messages in order of ascending or
descending score.

<H3>Scores for use in Patterns</H3>

The Patterns used for Roles, Index Line Coloring, and Filtering have a
category labeled &quot;Score Interval&quot;.
When a message is being compared with a Pattern to check for a match, if
the Score Interval is set only messages that have a score somewhere in
the interval are a match.

<H2>Scoring Rule Patterns</H2>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches a scoring rule
the message is compared with the rule's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, Other Rules, and Search Rules, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;.

<P>
Actually, Scoring rule Patterns are slightly different from the other types of
Patterns because Scoring rule Patterns don't contain a Score Interval.
In other words, when calculating the score for a message, which is done
by looking at the Scoring rule Patterns, scores aren't used.

<H2>Score Value</H2>

This is the value that will be added to the score for a message if the
rule's Pattern is a match.
Each individual Score Value is an integer between -100 and 100, and the
values from matching rules are added together to get a message's score.
There is also a way to extract the value from a particular header of each
message. See the help text for Score Value for further information.

<H2>Command Descriptions</H2>

<H3>Add</H3>

The Add command is used to add a new scoring rule definition.
The new rule will be added after the highlighted rule.

<H3>Delete</H3>

The Delete command deletes the currently highlighted scoring rule.

<H3>Change</H3>

The Change command lets you edit the nickname, Pattern,
and Score Value of the currently highlighted scoring rule.

<H3>Shuffle</H3>

The Shuffle command allows you to change the order of the scoring rules.
You may move the currently highlighted rule up or down in the list.
The order of the rules is important since the rules are tested for a
match starting with the first rule and continuing until a match is found.
You should place the rules with more specific Patterns near the beginning
of the list, and those with more general Patterns near the end so that
the more specific matches will happen when appropriate.

<H3>Replicate</H3>

The Replicate command is used to copy an existing rule and modify it.
The new rule will be added after the highlighted rule.

<H3>IncludeFile</H3>

The IncludeFile command allows you to add a rules file to your configuration.
Usually, your rules will be contained in your Alpine configuration file.
If you wish, some or all of your rules may be stored in a separate file.
If a rules file already exists (maybe it was made by somebody else using
Alpine), you may insert it before the currently highlighted rule.
You may also insert an empty file or a file that does not yet exist.
Once you have an empty rules file in your configuration, you may use
the Shuffle command to move rules into it.
In fact, that's the only way to get the initial rule into the file.

<H3>eXcludeFile</H3>

The eXcludeFile command removes a rules file from your rules configuration.
A limitation of the program is that in order to exclude a rules file
that file must have at least one rule
in it, otherwise you won't be able to highlight a line in the file.
So you may have to add a dummy rule to the file in order to exclude the file.

<H2>Description of the Setup LDAP Directory Servers Screen</H2>

This screen lets you add, delete, modify, or change the order of your
directory servers. You may also set some optional behavior for each server.
The &quot;Add Dir&quot; command brings up a blank form to 
fill in. You will have to supply at least the name of the LDAP server.
You will often have to supply a search base to be used with that server,
as well. Once the form has been brought up on your screen, there is help
available for each of the options you may set.
<P>
The &quot;Del Dir&quot; command allows you to remove a directory server
from your configuration.
<P>
The &quot;Change&quot; command is similar to the &quot;Add Dir&quot; command.
The difference is that instead of bringing up a form for a new server
configuration, you are changing the configuration of an existing entry.
For example, you might want to correct a typing error, change a
nickname, or change one of the options set for that server.
<P>
The &quot;Shuffle&quot; command is used to change the order of directory
servers.

If you say No, then the operation is aborted.
Export might be a reasonable way to store a backup or an archival copy of
a folder.
The exported-to file is a local file on the system where you are running Alpine.
The &quot;Import&quot; command is the opposite of the Export command.
It reads a file created by Export and asks where it should save it in your
folders.
This could be a new folder or an existing folder.
If the folder already exists, the messages from the exported file will be
appended to the folder.
<P>
<CENTER>Description of the FOLDER LIST Screen</CENTER>

The purpose of the FOLDER LIST screen is to help you browse and manage
the folders and directories (also known as &quot;hierarchy&quot;)
contained within a collection.

<P>
Folders and directories are arranged alphabetically across lines of
the screen.  Directories, if present, are denoted by a special
character at the end of the name known as the hierarchy delimiter
(typically, &quot;/&quot;).  By default, folders and directories are
mixed together.  The
"<A HREF="h_config_fld_sort_rule"><!--#echo var="VAR_folder-sort-rule"--></A>"
configuration option can be used to group directories toward the 
beginning or end of the list.

<P>
The Next/Prev Page commands help browse the list, the Next/Prev Fldr
commands change the &quot;selected&quot; (i.e., highlighted) folder or
directory, and the View Fldr/Dir commands will &quot;open&quot; the
selected item.  Folder and directory management is provided via the
Rename, Delete and Add commands.

<P><CENTER>About Folders</CENTER>
What are Folders?<P>

Folders are simply files where messages are kept.  Every message has to be
in a folder.  Most every Alpine user starts out with 3 folders: an INBOX, a
folder for sent mail and a folder for saved messages.<P>

You may create as many other folders as you wish.  They must be given
names that can be filenames on the filesystem.  
<P>

You can move messages from one folder to another by opening the original
folder and saving messages into the other folder just as you can save
message from your INBOX to any other folder.<P>

Folders are typically just files in the filesystem.  However, the files
that are
folders have some special formatting in them (so that Alpine knows where one
message ends and another begins) and should <EM>not</EM> be edited outside of
Alpine.  If you want copies of your messages in text files that you can edit
or otherwise manipulate, use the Export command to copy them from Alpine into
your regular file area.

<P>
FOR MORE INFORMATION: See the section on
<A HREF="h_valid_folder_names">Valid Folder Names</A>.
<P>
<CENTER>About Directories</CENTER>
<P>
A directory is simply a container used to group folders within a
folder list.  You can create as many directories as you like.  And 
directories can even contain directories themselves.

<P>
SPECIAL NOTES: When accessing folders on an IMAP server, it is important
to note that not all IMAP servers support directories.  If you find that
the Add command fails to offer the &quot;Create Directory&quot; subcommand,
then it's likely that directories are not supported by the server serving
in that collection.

<P>
Similarly, servers that do provide for directories may not do so in
the same way.  On some servers, for example, each folder name you
create is at the same time capable of being a directory.  When this
happens, Alpine will display both the folder name and the name of the
directory (with trailing hierarchy delimiter) in the folder list.

<P>
Another issue with IMAP access, though with a much smaller set of servers,
is that not all servers accept the request to list out the available
folders and directories in the same way.  If you find yourself having
trouble viewing folders on your server, you might investigate the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_lame_list_mode"><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-lame-list-mode"--></A>&quot;
feature.

<H1>Folder Name Syntax Explained</H1>

Once your folder collections are defined, you can usually refer to
folders by their simple (unqualified) name, or pick from a FOLDER LIST
display.  However, understanding the complete syntax for folder names,
both local and remote, is handy when using the Goto command and when
you are adding new folder collections via the Setups/collectionList screen.
<P>
An Alpine folder name looks like

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[{&lt;remote-specification&gt;}][#&lt;namespace&gt;]&lt;namespace-specific-part&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

The square brackets ([]) mean that the part is optional.

<P>
If there is no remote-specification, then the folder name is interpreted
locally on the computer running Alpine.
Local folder names depend on the operating system used by the computer 
running Alpine, as well as the configuration of that system.  For example,
&quot;C:&#92;PINE&#92;FOLDERS&#92;OCT-94&quot; might exist on a PC, and
&quot;~/mail/september-1994&quot; might be a reasonable folder name on a
system running Unix.

<P>
Alpine users have the option of using folders that are stored on some other
computer.  Alpine accesses remote folders via IMAP (the Internet Message
Access Protocol), or in the case of news, via NNTP (the Network News
Transport Protocol).  To be able to access remote folders in Alpine, the
remote host must be running the appropriate server software (imapd or
nntpd) and you must correctly specify the name of the folder to Alpine,
including the domain name of the remote machine. For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#123;monet.art.example.com}INBOX</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
could be a remote folder specification, and so could
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#123;unixhost.art.example.com}~/mail/september-1994</SAMP></CENTER>
and
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#123;winhost.art.example.com}&#92;mymail&#92;SEP-94</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Note that in the case of remote folders, the directory/file path in the specification is 
determined by the operating system of the remote computer, <B>not</B> by
the operating system of the computer on which you are running Alpine.
<P>
As you can tell, the name of the computer is in &#123;} brackets
followed immediately by the name of the folder.  (In each of these cases the
optional namespace is missing.)  If, as in these
examples, there is no remote access protocol specified, then IMAP is
assumed.  Check
<A HREF="h_folder_server_syntax">here</A>
for a more detailed look at what options can be placed between the brackets.
If there are no brackets at all, then the folder name is interpreted locally
on the computer on which you are running Alpine.

<P>
To the right of the brackets when a server name is present, or at the
start of the foldername if no server is present, the sharp sign,
&quot;#&quot;, holds special meaning.  It indicates a folder name
outside the area reserved for your personal folders.  In fact, it's
used to indicate both the name of the folder, and a special phrase
telling Alpine how to interpret the name that follows.

<P>
So, for example, Alpine can be used to access a newsgroup that might be 
available on your computer using:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The sharp sign indicates the folder name is outside your personal
folder area.  The &quot;news.&quot; phrase after it tells Alpine to 
interpret the remainder of the name as a newsgroup.

<P>
Similarly, to access a newsgroup on your IMAP server, you might
use something like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#123;wharhol.art.example.com}#news.comp.mail.misc</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
There are a number of such special phrases (or &quot;namespaces&quot;)
available.  For a more detailed explanation read about
<A HREF="h_folder_name_namespaces">Namespaces</A>.

<P>
Note that &quot;INBOX&quot; has special meaning in both local and remote folder
names.  The name INBOX refers to your &quot;principal incoming
message folder&quot; and will be mapped to the actual file name used for your
INBOX on any given host.  Therefore, a name like
&quot;&#123;xxx.art.example.com}INBOX&quot; refers to whatever file is used to
store incoming mail for you on that particular host.

<H1>Folder Name Namespaces Explained</H1>

An Alpine folder name looks like

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[{&lt;remote-specification&gt;}][#&lt;namespace&gt;][&lt;namespace-specific-part&gt;]</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

The local part of a folder name has an optional &quot;Namespace&quot; which
tells Alpine how to interpret the rest of the name.

<P> 
By default the folder name is interpreted as defining a section of your personal
folder area.  This area and how you specify it are defined by the
server, if one is specified, or, typically, the home
directory, if no server is defined.

<P>
If a namespace is specified, it begins with the
sharp, &quot;#&quot;, character followed by the name of the namespace
and then the namespace's path-element-delimiter.  Aside from the
path's format, namespaces can also imply access rights, content
policy, audience, location, and, occasionally, access methods.

<P>
Each server exports its own set (possibly of size one) of 
namespaces.  Hence, it's likely communication with your server's
administrator will be required for specific configurations.  Some of
the more common namespaces, however, include:

<DL>
<DT>#news.</DT>
<DD>This specifies a set of folders in the newsgroup namespace.  Newsgroup
names are hierarchically defined with each level delimited by a period.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>
<DT>#public/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that the server may export to the general
public.
</DD>
<DT>#shared/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that the server may export to groups
of users.
</DD>
<DT>#ftp/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that is the same as that it may have 
exported via the &quot;File Transfer Protocol&quot;.
</DD>
<DT>#mh/</DT>
<DD>This specifies the personal folder area associated with folders
and directories that were created using the MH message handling system.
</DD>
<DT>#move/</DT>
<DD>This namespace is interpreted locally by Alpine. It has an unusual interpretation and format.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#move&lt;DELIM&gt;&lt;MailDropFolder&gt;&lt;DELIM&gt;&lt;DestinationFolder&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The #move namespace is followed by two folder names separated by a delimiter
character.
The delimiter character may be any character that does not appear in
the MailDropFolder name.
The meaning of #move is that mail will be copied from the MailDropFolder to
the DestinationFolder and then deleted (if possible) from the MailDropFolder.
Periodic checks at frequency
<A HREF="h_config_mailcheck"><!--#echo var="VAR_mail-check-interval"--></A>, but with a minimum
time between checks set by
<A HREF="h_config_maildropcheck"><!--#echo var="VAR_maildrop-check-minimum"--></A>,
are made for new mail arriving in the MailDropFolder.
An example that copies mail from a POP inbox to a local folder follows
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#move+{popserver.example.com/pop3/ssl}inbox+local folder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
To you it appears that mail is being delivered to the local folder when it
is copied from the MailDropFolder, and you read mail from the local folder.
<P>
Note that if the DestinationFolder does not exist then the messages are not
copied from the MailDropFolder.
A #move folder may only be used as an
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;Incoming folder&quot;</A> or
an Inbox.
When you are in the FOLDER LIST of Incoming Message Folders (after turning
on the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-incoming-folders"-->&quot;</A>
option)
the Add command has a subcommand &quot;Use Mail Drop&quot;
which may be helpful for defining the folder in your Alpine configuration.
The same is true when you edit the
<A HREF="h_config_inbox_path"><!--#echo var="VAR_inbox-path"--></A>
option in Setup/Config.
Each of these configuration methods will also create the DestinationFolder
if it doesn't already exist.
If you are having problems, make sure the DestinationFolder exists.
You may find some more useful information about Mail Drops at
<A HREF="h_maildrop">What is a Mail Drop?</A>.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>

In addition, the server may support access to other user's folders,
provided you have suitable permissions.  Common methods use a prefix
of either &quot;~<VAR>user</VAR>/&quot;, or &quot;/<VAR>user</VAR>/&quot; to
indicate the root of the other user's folder area.

<P>
No, nothing's simple.

<H1>FOLDER SUBSCRIBE HELP</H1>

This screen is designed to help you subscribe to newsgroups you are
not currently subscribed to.  The screen display is a list of all
available newsgroups (or possibly a partial list if you specified a
partial name when entering the screen).  Groups you have already
subscribed to have the letters &quot;SUB&quot; next to them.  You may
select a single new group to subscribe to by moving the cursor to that
group and pressing &quot;S&quot; or carriage return.  Alternatively,
you may change into ListMode with the &quot;ListMode&quot; command.
The display will change slightly so that each group has a checkbox in
front of it.  Use the cursor and the Set/Unset command to place an
&quot;X&quot; in front of each newsgroup you wish to subscribe to.
<P>

When you are finished marking groups, the &quot;Subscribe&quot;
command will subscribe you to those groups you have marked.  Note, you
may not unsubscribe to groups with this command.  Instead of the
&quot;A&quot; &quot;Subscribe&quot; command, use the &quot;D&quot;
UnSbscrbe command.

<H2>Description of the Setup Address Books Screen</H2>

This screen lets you add, delete, modify, or change the order of your
address books.  The &quot;Add Abook&quot; command brings up a blank form to 
fill in.  If you are adding a remote address book on an IMAP server
you should fill in the name of the IMAP server.  Otherwise, leave
that field blank.  (Note that remote IMAP address books are an Alpine
concept and are unlikely to interoperate with other mail clients.)
For a remote address book, fill in the name of the remote folder
in the Folder field.  This should be a folder that is used only for
this one purpose, not a general purpose folder you expect to store
messages in.
<P>If you are adding a local address book, fill in the
Folder Name field with a local file name (e.g., .addressbook).
<P>
<B>Please note:</B> Remote address books stored on an IMAP server are 
of an entirely different format (namely, a special-purpose 
&quot;mail folder&quot;) than that of the local addressbook familiar 
to Alpine users.  Therefore, 
you cannot use &quot;add a remote address book&quot; to make an existing 
Alpine .addressbook file you may have on a remote IMAP server accessible to 
Alpine running on a different host.  
<P>

The &quot;Del Abook&quot; command allows you to remove an address book
from your configuration.  It will also ask you if you wish to remove
the data for that address book, which would erase all traces of the
address book if you answer Yes.
<P>

The &quot;Change&quot; command is similar to the &quot;Add Abook&quot; command.
The difference is that instead of adding a new address book to your
configuration, you are changing the configuration of an existing entry.
For example, you might want to correct a typing error or change a
nickname.  The &quot;Change&quot; command is not a move command.  If you
change the folder name or server name the data will not be moved for you.
<P>

The &quot;Shuffle&quot; command is used for two purposes.  If you shuffle
an address book toward another address book in the same group then
the order of those two address books will be swapped.  If you shuffle
the last Personal address book down towards the Global address book
section, it will become a Global address book.  If you shuffle
the first Global address book up it will become a Personal address
book.  The main difference between Personal and Global address
books is that Global address books are forced read-only.

<H2>Description of the Address Book Screen</H2>

This screen lets you edit and manage entries in your address book.  It
also acts as a short-cut for composing messages to people in the address
book.  When, from this screen, you press <!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F11<!--chtml else-->&quot;C&quot;<!--chtml endif--> for ComposeTo, the
message starts &quot;pre-addressed&quot; to whatever address book entry is
currently selected.  If you use the <!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F8<!--chtml else-->&quot;#&quot;<!--chtml endif--> for Role, you may first select a
role to use in your composition.
<P>
Alpine's address book helps you keep a list of addresses you send email to so
you do not have to remember addresses that are often complex.  Each entry
in the address book has five fields, all of them optional.  The three
elements that are usually visible on the ADDRESS BOOK display, are: <DL>

	<P><DT>NICKNAME: <DD>A short easy-to-remember label to identify the entry.
	This is what you type in as you are addressing the message in the
	composer.  If there is a matching entry in your address book(s),
	Alpine will extract the corresponding FullName and Address fields to
	generate the actual address for your message.

	<P><DT>FULLNAME: <DD>A longer field where you can put the full name 
of the
	person or organization.  Usually the full names are put in last
	name first so they sort nicely in alphabetical order.  Whatever
	you put as the name here will appear on the message when it is
	finally delivered.  Examples:<PRE>
	   Garcia Marquez, Gabriel
	   Henscheid, Eckhard
	   Alpine-Info mailing list
	   Library materials renewal requests
	   Kim An-guk
	   &quot;George III, King of Great Britain, 1738-1820&quot;
</PRE>
(In the second-to-last example, no comma is used in the name so that 
the family name appears first in the address book and when the entry is 
used in the composer.
In the last example, retaining the commas is intended; 
double-quotation marks surround the name to 
prevent the transposition of its parts when the entry is used in 
the composer.)

	<P><DT>ADDRESS: <DD>This is the actual email address itself.  This must be
	a valid Internet address that conforms to the Internet message
	header standard, RFC-822.  (See also <A HREF="h_address_format">Explanation of Address formats</A>.)</DL>

The two fields that aren't usually visible are:<DL>

  <P><DT>FCC: <DD>The name of the folder you would like a copy of any outgoing
	message to this address to be saved in.  If this field is set, and
	this address is the first one in the message's To: header, then
	Alpine will use this folder name for the FCC in lieu of the normal
	FCC folder name.

  <P><DT>COMMENTS: <DD>This field contains arbitrary text for your convenience.
	</DL>
<P>
Due to screen width limitations, these last two fields do not show up in
the normal ADDRESS BOOK display.  You may select the 
&quot;View/Update&quot; command to
view or modify them.  You may use the configuration variable
<A HREF="h_config_abook_formats">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_addressbook-formats"-->&quot;</A>
to add these fields to your ADDRESS BOOK 
display, or to modify the format of the display.

<H2>Sorting the Address book</H2>

By default, address book entries are sorted alphabetically on the full
name with distribution lists sorted to the end.  Sorting can be changed by
resetting the address book sort rule in the Alpine SETUP CONFIGURATION screen
--assuming you have &quot;write&quot; permission for the address book file.
<P>
Unlike the sorting of folders (which only changes presentation), sorting an
address book actually changes the file as it is kept on the computer.  For
this reason you won't be able to sort a shared or system-wide address
book.

<H2>Adding New Entries</H2>

The easiest way to add new entries to your address book is to use the
&quot;TakeAddr&quot; command when viewing a message.
This command allows you to take addresses from the header and body of the
message and put them into your address book, without having to type
them in.
<P>

To manually add a new entry from within the address book screen, use the AddNew
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F9<!--chtml else-->&quot;@&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) command.
Use this command both for adding a simple alias and for adding a
distribution list.

<H2>Distribution Lists</H2>

Address book entries can be simple cases of aliases (a single nickname is linked
to a single email address) or distribution lists (a single nickname
pointing at more than one email address).  Each distribution list has a
nickname, a full name and a list of addresses.  The addresses may be
actual addresses or they may be other nicknames in your address book.
They may even refer to other distribution lists.
There's really no difference between a simple alias and a distribution list,
other than the number of addresses.
Therefore, you can turn a simple alias with one address into a distribution
list simply by adding more addresses.
To add entries to an existing list or alias
use the View/Update (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F4<!--chtml else-->&quot;&gt;&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) command.  Delete (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F10<!--chtml else-->&quot;D&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) will delete
a single address from the list if the cursor is placed on the address;
it will delete the entire distribution list if the cursor is on the
nickname/fullname line.  View/Update may also be used to delete addresses
from a list.
<P>
Address field entries in distribution lists may take any one of three
forms: a nickname existing in any of the defined address books, a normal
address of the form &quot;jsmith@art.example.com&quot;, or a complete
fullname/address combination, e.g. &quot;John Smith
&lt;jsmith@art.example.com&gt;&quot;.
<P>
Distribution lists in Alpine address books can only be used by the person or
people who have access to that address book.  They are not usually used to
implement discussion groups, but can be used to facilitate small
discussion groups if all the participants have access to the same shared
address book.

<H2>FCC and Comments</H2>

As mentioned above, each entry in the address book also has two other optional
fields, Fcc and Comments.  The command to look at or change either of these
is the same View/Update command used for all of the fields (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F4<!--chtml else-->&quot;&gt;&quot;<!--chtml endif-->).  The
Comments field is just for your own use.  The Fcc field overrides the
default Fcc if this address is the first one on the To line.  The WhereIs
command may be used to search for particular strings in the address book,
including fields that are not visible (like Comment and Fcc by default).

<H2>Aggregate Operations</H2>

If the feature
<A HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-aggregate-command-set"-->&quot;</A>
is turned on (the default), then the four commands &quot;Select&quot;,
&quot;Select Current&quot;, &quot;Zoom&quot;, and &quot;Apply&quot;
are available.  The two selection commands allow you to mark a set of
address book entries as being selected.  If you have more than one address
book, the selections may be in more than one of those address books.
The &quot;Zoom&quot; command will toggle between displaying only the selected
entries and all of the entries.  The &quot;Apply&quot; command allows you to
apply one of the regular address book commands to all of the selected
entries.  Usually the address book commands apply to only the entry
highlighted by the cursor.  The &quot;Apply&quot; command works with the
commands &quot;ComposeTo&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot;, &quot;Print&quot;, 
&quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Forward&quot;, and &quot;Role&quot;.

<H2>Exporting and Forwarding Address book entries</H2>

Under the save option, when you use the Export (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F11<!--chtml else-->&quot;X&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) command, the currently highlighted
address book entry is placed in a plain text file in your home directory
<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
(which, in the present configuration of your system, is
 &quot;<!--#echo var="HOME_DIR"-->&quot;) 
<!--chtml endif-->
or current working directory
<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
(which, at least for your current Alpine &quot;session,&quot; 
is &quot;<!--#echo var="CURRENT_DIR"-->&quot;) 
<!--chtml endif-->, depending on the 
<A HREF="h_config_use_current_dir">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_use-current-dir"-->&quot;</A>
configuration setting.  If you have some entries selected and use the
Apply (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F7<!--chtml else-->&quot;A&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) Export command, all of the selected addresses will be
placed in the text file.
<P>
When you use the Forward (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F12<!--chtml else-->&quot;F&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) command, the currently highlighted
address book entry is placed in a special attachment and you are put into
the composer.  You can fill in some comments in the body of the message,
if you'd like, and send it to somebody else who uses Alpine.  The recipient
may use the TakeAddr command on that message to insert the address book
entry you sent in their own address book.  If you have some entries
selected and use the Apply Forward command all of the selected entries
will be forwarded in a single message.  You may
use Apply (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F7<!--chtml else-->&quot;A&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) Forward to forward a copy of an entire address book.
The recipient must be using Alpine in order to receive this correctly.
One way for the recipient to handle this might be to create an empty
address book and then &quot;Take&quot; your forwarded address book entries into
that empty address book.

<H2>Multiple and/or Site-Wide Address books</H2>

You may have more than one personal address book.  In addition, there may
be one or more global address books.  This capability allows you to have
multiple personal address books (some of which may be shared) and it also
allows system administrators to implement site-wide address books that
contain entries for users on multiple machines within the organization.
<P><DL>
<DT>Searching
  <DD> If you enter a nickname when composing a message, your
  personal address books will be searched through in order, and then the
  global address book(s) searched. If more than one address book has an entry
  for the nickname, Alpine uses the first one that it finds, so an entry in
  your personal address book would override a global address book entry. If
  after searching all the address books there is still no match, (Unix) Alpine
  then searches the local host password file on the assumption that you have
  entered a local user name rather than an address book nickname.
  You may change the search order of your address books with the <!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F3<!--chtml else-->$<!--chtml endif--> Shuffle
  command, but global address books are always searched after personal
  address books.

  <P><DT>Tab completion
  <DD> If the
  <A HREF="h_config_enable_tab_complete"><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-tab-completion"--></A>
  feature is turned on (the default) then the Tab key may be used
  in the composer to complete partially typed nicknames in the To
  or Cc lines. You type the first few letters of a nickname and then
  press the Tab key. It there is only one nickname that matches it will
  be filled in by Alpine. If there is more than one the unambiguous part
  of the nicknames will be filled in. For example, if your address book or
  books contains only the two entries &quot;barley&quot; and &quot;barbecue&quot;
  beginning with the letters &quot;ba&quot;, then if you type &quot;ba&quot;
  followed by a Tab character Alpine will fill in &quot;bar&quot; and stop.
  If you then type a second Tab character you will be presented with a list
  of matching nicknames to select from. Alternatively, you could type another
  &quot;b&quot; resulting in &quot;barb&quot; and then a Tab would fill
  in the entire &quot;barbecue&quot; entry.

  <P><DT>Defining
  <DD> You define multiple personal address books in the 
  <A HREF="h_abook_config">SETUP AddressBooks</A> screen, which you may reach
  from the MAIN MENU.  
  You may add as many as you like.  Global address books are usually
  site-wide address books defined by the System administrator, but
  you may define global address books of your own just like you define
  personal address books.

  <P><DT>Creating and updating
  <DD> Personal address books are normally created empty
  and populated by explicit additions from within Alpine, e.g. via the
  TakeAddr command.  Unlike personal address books, global address books may
  not be modified/updated from within Alpine; that is, they are Read-Only.
  Thus, global address books are created, populated and updated outside of
  Alpine. They might be hand-edited, generated by a program from another
  database, or by copying an existing address book.  They might also be
  some other user's personal address book, and so be modified normally by
  that user but accessed Read-Only by you.  See the Alpine Technical
  Notes document (included in the Alpine distribution) for more information on
  this.

  <P><DT>Accessing
  <DD>There are two different types of address books in Alpine.
  A local address book is stored in a regular file and the normal file
  access permissions apply.  A remote address book is stored on an IMAP
  server in a special folder that contains only messages pertaining to
  that address book.  The last message in the remote folder contains a
  copy of the address book data, and that data is copied to a local cache
  file in your home directory.  From there it is accessed just like a local
  address book.  The name of the cache file is kept track of in a special
  file called the
  <A HREF="h_config_abook_metafile"><!--#echo var="VAR_remote-abook-metafile"--></A>,
  the name of which is stored in
  your Alpine configuration file the first time you use a remote address book.
  Just as local Alpine address books use a format that only Alpine understands,
  remote Alpine address books do the same and other mail reading programs
  are unlikely to be able to understand them.<P>
  While global address books are explicitly intended to be shared, there is
  nothing to prevent you from sharing a personal address book with other
  Alpine users. This might be useful in the case of a small workgroup.
  However, it is recommended that updates to shared personal address books
  be done when other Alpine users are not accessing the address book. Alpine
  does not do any file-locking to manage concurrent updates to the
  addressbook, but it does check to see if the file has been modified before
  making any changes.  Consequently, inadvertent concurrent updates will
  only cause other Alpine users to have to restart their address book
  operation, which will cause Alpine to reopen the updated file.

  <P><DT>Converting to Remote
  <DD>The easiest way to convert an existing local
  address book into a remote address book is to create an empty new remote
  personal address book by typing &quot;A&quot; to execute the
  &quot;Add Pers Abook&quot; command in the SETUP Addressbook screen.
  Make sure you add a <EM>personal</EM> address book, not a <EM>global</EM>
  address book.
  After you have added the empty
  remote address book, go into the screen for the address book you wish
  to copy and &quot;Select&quot; &quot;All&quot;.
  This selects every entry in that
  address book.  Then type the command &quot;Apply Save&quot;.
  You will be asked for the address book to save to.  You may use ^P and ^N
  to get to the new empty address book, then hit RETURN and the addresses
  will be copied.
  At this point you'll probably want to unselect all the entries in the local
  address book before proceeding. You do that with
  &quot;Select&quot; &quot;unselect All&quot;.

<H2>Description of the Take Address Screen</H2>

This screen is designed to let you select one or more address/name
combinations from the current message and put them into your address book.
The cursor is initially placed on the line with the message author.
Other lines include the names of people and/or mailing lists who also
received the message.  Other people &quot;involved&quot; in the
message (e.g. the person named as Reply-To:) are also listed here.
<P>

The simple case is adding a new, single entry into your address book. To
do this, simply highlight the correct line and press 
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
F4.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;T&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
To create a new list or add to an existing list, switch the screen display
into List Mode by pressing
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
F12.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;L&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
In List Mode, you select the
group of addresses you wish to manipulate by marking them with an
&quot;X&quot;.
The Set/Unset
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
(F9)
<!--chtml else-->
(&quot;X&quot;)
<!--chtml endif-->
command will turn the &quot;X&quot; on for the
highlighted address if it was off or turn it off if it was previously on.
The SetAll command will select all of the addresses, and the UnSetAll
command will turn off all the selections.  Once you've gotten the
selection the way you want it, you may create a new list by pressing
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
F4.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;T&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
<P>

In both the simple and list cases, after choosing to take the address,
you will be asked for the nickname of the entry.  Typing in a new name
creates the new entry/list.  Entering an existing nickname will replace
the entry (simple case) or add to the list (list case).  Alternatively,
you can press Ctrl-T at the nickname prompt and select an existing
nickname from your address book.
<P>

You will normally start in Single Mode, unless you used the Apply command
to startup the TakeAddr screen, in which case you will start in List Mode.
You may switch between the two modes at any time.  If you've already
selected several addresses in List Mode, those will be remembered when you
switch to Single Mode and then back to List Mode.  The set of addresses
that are pre-selected when you start in List Mode are the From addresses
of all of the messages you are operating on.  You may, of course, easily
erase those selections with the UnSetAll command.
<P>

If you have more than one writable address book, you will be prompted for
the name of the address book you wish to add the new entry to before
anything else. You can use ^N and ^P to choose among the defined address
books, or type in the address book name.
<P>

You will be asked for the name of a file to put the addresses in.
If the file already exists, you will be asked whether you want to Overwrite

<H1>Getting Help In PC-Alpine</H1>

<P>
PC-Alpine offers general and specific help text. From the <A
HREF="main_menu_tx">MAIN MENU</A>, you will find an overview in the MAIN
MENU HELP and the <A HREF="h_news">Release Notes</A>.  On all screens,
specific help for that screen is available from the toolbar Help menu or
with the 
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
&quot;F1&quot; key.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;?&quot; or &quot;Ctrl-G&quot; keys. &quot;Ctrl-G&quot; is used where
typing &quot;?&quot; would be mistaken as entering text.
<!--chtml endif-->

<P>
Although this version of Alpine is for Microsoft Windows, it is not
considered a full &quot;Graphical User Interface&quot; application. 
Yet, many of the controls that Windows users are accustomed to seeing, 
such as scrollbars and toolbars, are available.

<P>
PC-Alpine offers considerable mouse support.  You can view what is
&quot;click-able&quot; by dragging your mouse over any screen; when the
arrow cursor changes into a hand, you found something. Mouse-click
possibilities include navigating between screens and folders and
double-clicking on hyperlinks to open your Web browser.
Context-sensitive pop-up menus appear with a right-click on your PC-Alpine
screen.  Examples of right-click options include &quot;copy&quot; after
selecting text to copy and &quot;View in New Window&quot; when you click
on a particular message in the Message Index. The menu choices available
to you will vary based upon what screen is open, where on the screen your
cursor is located, and even what action you have already taken.

HINT: To move rapidly to the bottom of a message you are composing,
enter ^W^V.  To go to the top, ^W^Y.  These can be used in conjunction
with the Mark and Cut commands to eliminate large amounts of unwanted

<H2>Description of Composer</H2>

Alpine has a built-in editing program that allows you to compose messages
without having to leave Alpine.  The editor is designed to be very simple to
use so that you can get started writing email right away.

<P>
Messages are usually just text, about 80 columns wide.  Using upper and
lower case is encouraged.  On some systems the size limit of the message
is about 100,000 characters, which is about 2,000 lines.  You can include
punctuation and special characters found on most keyboards, but you can't
include characters with diacritical marks and certain special symbols.

<P>
Text automatically wraps as you type past the end of a line so you do not
have to hit return.  Using the
&quot;<A HREF="h_compose_justify">Justify</A>&quot; command,
you can also reformat text explicitly, perhaps after you have
deleted some text.

<P>
You can include other text files with the 
&quot;<A HREF="h_compose_readfile">Read File</A>&quot; command,
which will prompt you for the name of the file to insert at the
current cursor postion.

<LI>Note <B>if</B> you are currently using the BROWSER for choosing a file for 
inclusion in the 
message body (that is, you chose &quot;Read File&quot; with the cursor under 
the 
&quot;----- Message Text -----&quot; line
while composing, then &quot;To Files&quot;):  Since the file 
selected will become part of the message text, it must be in a format 
suitable for that (Alpine does not check!), such as a plain text file.
Files of other formats (for example, graphics, databases, software 
programs) should be 
<B>attached</B> to the message instead --
by moving the cursor in the COMPOSE MESSAGE screen into the 
message header area and pressing

<P><LI>
Note <B>if</B> you are currently using the BROWSER for saving a message 
attachment, or exporting a message, to a file: You can use the Add command to 
provide the name for a new file to save/export to, and then select that name 
to use it for the save/export operation.  Back at the prompt 
&quot;EXPORT: Copy message to file in ...&quot; hit Enter, then choose 
either Overwrite or Append (it doesn't make a difference, since the file is 
so far empty).  Note: If you cancel the

<H1>Help For Whereis Command</H1>

Whereis is used to search the message for a word or part of a word.
When searching in the composer, only the message part of your mail is
searched, and the cursor is put on the first occurrence appearing
after the location of the cursor.  The search will wrap to the
beginning of the message when it no longer finds matches in the
remainder of the message.

To search for the same string a second time, press 
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
&quot;F6&quot;
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;^W&quot;
<!--chtml endif-->
to begin search and then just press RETURN to accept the previous
search string shown in square brackets rather than entering a new
search string.<P>

The &quot;Search&quot; prompt has several sub-command available:

<DL>
<DT>Get Help</DT>
<DD> Takes you to this help page.

<DT>Cancel</DT>
<DD> Cancels the prompt.  No search takes place.

<DT>First Line</DT>
<DD> Takes you back to the composer with the cursor on the first character
of the first line of text.

<DT>Last Line</DT>
<DD> Takes you back to the composer with the cursor on the last character
of the last line of text.

<DT>Replace (Optional)</DT>
<DD> This sub-command is enabled by the 
<A HREF="h_config_enable_search_and_repl">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-search-and-replace"-->&quot;</A>

<TITLE>THE MESSAGE COMPOSER'S BCC FIELD</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>THE MESSAGE COMPOSER'S BCC FIELD</H1>
The &quot;Bcc:&quot; (Blind carbon copy) header is used when you wish to send 
a copy of the message to one or more people whose addresses you do not
wish disclosed, either to reduce clutter or for confidentiality.
<P>
The format of the Bcc: field is just the same as the To: and Cc: fields in
the way the addresses are entered.  The recipients listed here will
receive a copy of the message, but --assuming your site's mail transport
software is properly configured-- their addresses will not show up in the
headers of the message, as delivered to all of the recipients.  The To:
and Cc:  recipients will not know a copy was sent to the Bcc: recipients.
<P>
Note: if there is no To: or Cc: or Lcc: address in the message, Alpine
will automatically generate and place in the To: field a pseudo-address of 
  &quot;undisclosed-recipients: ;&quot;
or whatever string has been specified in the 
<A HREF="h_config_empty_hdr_msg">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_empty-header-message"-->&quot;</A>
variable.
<P>
The reason for this is to avoid embarrassment caused by some Internet
mail transfer software that interprets a &quot;missing&quot; To: header as 
an error and replaces it with an Apparently-to: header that may contain
the addresses you entered on the Bcc: line.  In addition, it may be
less disconcerting to Bcc: recipients to see <B>something</B> in the To: field.
<P>
You can manipulate what text ends up on the (originally) empty To:
field.  Just remember to put a colon and semicolon at the end of the
field, which is a special notation denoting that it is not a real address.

<TITLE>THE MESSAGE COMPOSER'S LCC FIELD</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>THE MESSAGE COMPOSER'S LCC FIELD</H1>
The &quot;Lcc:&quot; (List carbon copy) header is intended to be used when
you wish to send a message to a list of people but avoid having all
of their addresses visible, in order to reduce clutter when the
message is received.
<P>
It is similar to the 
<A HREF="h_composer_bcc">&quot;Bcc&quot; (Blind carbon copy) header</A> 
in that individual
addressees are hidden, but Lcc is designed to work specifically with
distribution lists you have created in your 
<A HREF="h_abook_opened">Alpine Address Book</A>.  Placing
the nickname of the list on the Lcc line will result in the full name of
your Alpine Address Book list being placed on the To: line of the message,
using a special notation that distinguishes it from a real address. You
must leave the To: line blank for your list name to appear there.
<P>
For example, if you have this list entered in your Address Book:<PRE>

	largo         Key Largo List       DISTRIBUTION LIST:
					   bogie@mgm.com
					   lauren@mgm.com
					   walter@mgm.com</PRE>


and you enter &quot;largo&quot; on the Lcc: line while composing a message, 
the result is:<PRE>

	To      : Key Largo List: ;
	Cc      :
	Bcc     :
	Fcc     : sent-mail
	Lcc     : Key Largo List &lt;bogie@mgm.com&gt;,
		  lauren@mgm.com,
		  walter@mgm.com
	Subject :</PRE>

Each recipient listed on the Lcc: line receives a copy of the message
without their address being visible (as though they were listed on the
Bcc: line). The colon-semicolon notation used to put the full-name of the
list on the To: line is a special address format that doesn't specify any
actual addressees, but does give some information to the recipients of the
message.
<P>
Note: if after entering an LCC, you delete the list name that is placed
on the To: line, then recipients will see <PRE>
       To: undisclosed-recipients: ;</PRE>

(or whatever string is defined in the 
<A HREF="h_config_empty_hdr_msg">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_empty-header-message"-->&quot;</A>
variable) just as in the BCC case.

address other than your normal &quot;From:&quot; address.  This is atypical, 
but can happen when you use multiple machines and do not have the same account
name on each one, or when you wish to direct certain replies to accounts

<H1>THE MESSAGE COMPOSER'S ATTCHMNT FIELD</H1>

The &quot;Attchmnt:&quot; field is where you specify what file or
files you'd like attached to
the message you are composing.  Those files must reside on the machine
running Alpine. If your file is on a PC or Mac and you run Alpine with an
account on a Unix machine, you'll have to transfer it before attaching it.
Contact local computer support people for assistance with transferring.

<P>
The file name
given can be an absolute file path name for your system
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
(for example, &quot;H:&#92;SIGFILES&#92;FULLINFO.TXT&quot;), a file
with a relative pathname, or simply a file name without
drive or directory specification.  
<!--chtml else-->
(for example, &quot;/tmp/exported.earlier&quot; on Unix hosts), 
a file in your home directory, or a file path relative to your 
home directory.  In Unix Alpine, you may use &quot;~&quot; to refer to 
your home directory or &quot;~user&quot; to refer to another
account's home directory.
<!--chtml endif--><P>
No wild card characters may be used.
<P>If the 
<A HREF="h_config_use_current_dir">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_use-current-dir"-->&quot;</A>
feature is set, names are relative to your current working directory 
<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
(which, at least for your current Alpine &quot;session,&quot; 
is &quot;<!--#echo var="CURRENT_DIR"-->&quot;) 
<!--chtml endif-->
rather than your home directory
<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
(which, in the present configuration of your system, is
 &quot;<!--#echo var="HOME_DIR"-->&quot;) 
<!--chtml endif-->
.
<P>
Alpine uses MIME encoding for attachments, so binaries and files of any
length can safely be delivered to any MIME-capable mail reading program.
If you send an attachment to someone who does not have a MIME-capable mail
reading program yet, then the main message text will be readable, but
attachments (even attachments that are just plain text) are not.
<P>

Typing the filename on the Attchmnt: line achieves the same
result as using the 
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
F6
<!--chtml else-->
Ctrl-J
<!--chtml endif--> command.
<P>

If you Forward a message with attachments, you may delete them from your
Forwarded message by editing the Attchmnt header line.

<TITLE>Addressbook Fullname Explained</TITLE>

<BODY>
This is the full name field for this entry.  If this is going to be a
distribution list (more than one address), it should be a descriptive
phrase describing the list.  It will be included in the mail header if you
put the list in the To: or CC: field, or in the To: line if you put the
list in the Lcc: field.  It's OK to leave this field blank (and OK to
leave any of the other fields blank, too). If this address book entry is
going to be a simple entry with just one address, then this field is the
person's name. When you send mail to this entry, this is the field to the
left of the brackets. That is, it is the most readable part of the 
address. For example, in the sample address:
<PRE>
       John Doe &lt;jdoe@some.domain&gt;
</PRE>
"John Doe" is the full name field. If you are sorting your address book
with one of the options that uses full names, then it might be useful to
enter the full name as "Last, First", for example:
<PRE>
       Doe, John
</PRE>
so that it will be sorted using Doe instead of John. This will be changed
back into John Doe when you use it.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_combined-addrbook-display"--></H1>

This feature affects the address book display screens.
Normally, expanding an address book from the ADDRESS BOOK LIST screen
will cause the remaining address books and directory servers to disappear
from the screen, leaving only the entries of the expanded address book.
If this feature is set, then the other address books will remain on the screen,
so that all of the address books can be present at once.

For example, the Select All command will select all of the entries in the

from expanded address books.

<P>

<DL>
<DT>default</DT>
<DD>The color of the titlebar will be the color you set for the

The Title Color may be set by using the

</DD>

<DT>indexline</DT>
<DD>The color of the titlebar will be the same as the color of the
index line corresponding to the message being viewed.
The rules that determine what color the index line will be may be set
up by going to the Setup/Rules/Indexcolor screen.
If the index line for a message is not colored explicitly by the
Indexcolor rules, then the titlebar will be colored the same as for
the &quot;default&quot; option above (which is not the same color that
the index line itself will have).
</DD>

<DT>reverse-indexline</DT>
<DD>This is similar to the &quot;indexline&quot; option except the
foreground and background colors from the corresponding index line will
be reversed.
For example, if the index line color is red letters on a white background,
then the titlebar will be white letters on a red background.
If the index line for a message is not colored explicitly by the

This option affects the colors used to display the current line in the

If you do not have Index Color Rules defined, then this option will
have no effect in the index.
Those Rules may be defined by going to the Setup/Rules/Indexcolor screen.

this option also affects the color used to display the current folder
in the Incoming FOLDER LIST screen.

<P>
The available options include:
<P>

<DL>
<DT>flip-colors</DT>
<DD>This is the default.
If an index line is colored because it matches one of your
Index Color Rules, then its colors will be reversed when it is the currently
highlighted line.
For example, if the line is normally red text on a blue background, then
when it is the current line it will be drawn as blue text on a red background.
<P>
The rest of the option values all revert to this flip-colors behavior if
there is no Reverse Color defined.
</DD>

<DT>reverse</DT>
<DD>With this option the Reverse color is always used to highlight the
current line.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-fg</DT>
<DD>The foreground part of the Reverse Color is used to highlight
the current line.
If this would cause the text to be unreadable (because the foreground and
background colors are the same) or if it would cause no change in the
color of the index line, then the colors are flipped instead.
<P>
Some people think this works particularly well if you use different
background colors to emphasize &quot;interesting&quot; lines,
but always with the same Normal foreground color,
and you use a different foreground color for the Reverse Color.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-fg-no-ambiguity</DT>
<DD>With the &quot;reverse-fg&quot; rule above, it is possible that
the resulting color will be exactly the same as the regular Reverse
Color.
That can lead to some possible confusion because an
&quot;interesting&quot;
line that is the current line will be displayed exactly the same as a
non-interesting line that is current.
You can't tell whether the line is just a regular current line or if it is
an &quot;interesting&quot; current line by looking at the color.
Setting the option to this value removes that ambiguity.
It is the same as the &quot;reverse-fg&quot; setting unless the resulting
interesting current line would look just like a non-interesting current line.
In that case, the interesting line's colors are simply flipped (like in the
default behavior).
<P>
As an alternative way to preserve the line's interestingness in this case,
you may find that using both a different foreground and a different
background color for the interesting line will help.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-bg</DT>
<DD>The background part of the Reverse Color is used to highlight
the current line.
If this would cause the text to be unreadable (because the foreground and
background colors are the same) or if it would cause no change in the
color of the index line, then the colors are flipped instead.
<P>
Some people think this works particularly well if you use different
foreground colors to emphasize &quot;interesting&quot; lines,
but always with the same Normal background color,
and you use a different background color for the Reverse Color.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-bg-no-ambiguity</DT>
<DD>As with the &quot;reverse-fg&quot; case, the &quot;reverse-bg&quot;
rule may also result in a color that is exactly the same as the regular
Reverse Color.
Setting the option to this value removes that ambiguity.
It is the same as the &quot;reverse-bg&quot; setting unless the resulting
current line has the same color as the Reverse Color.
In that case, the interesting line's colors are simply flipped (like in the

<H1>LDAP FEATURE: Lookup-Addrbook-Contents</H1>

Normally implicit LDAP lookups from the composer are done only for the
strings you type in from the composer screen. In other words, you type in
something in the To or CC field and press return, then the string is looked up.
First that string is looked up in your address books. If a match is found
there, then the results of that match are looked up again. If you place
a string in your address book that you want to have looked up on the LDAP
directory server, you need to turn on this feature. If you set this feature
for a server, you almost always will also want to set the
<A HREF="h_config_ldap_opts_impl">&quot;Use-Implicitly-From-Composer&quot;</A>
feature. An example might serve to best illustrate this feature.
<P>
If an LDAP lookup of &quot;William Clinton&quot; normally returns an
entry with an
address of pres@whitehouse.gov, then you might put an entry in your address
book that looks like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Nickname = bill</SAMP></CENTER><BR>
<CENTER><SAMP>Address = &quot;William Clinton&quot;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Now, when you type &quot;bill&quot; into an
address field in the composer Alpine will
find the &quot;bill&quot; entry in your address book.
It will replace &quot;bill&quot; with
&quot;William Clinton&quot;.
It will then search for an entry with that nickname
in your address book and not find one. If this feature
is set, Alpine will then attempt to lookup
&quot;William Clinton&quot; on the LDAP server and find the entry with address
pres@whitehouse.gov.
<P>
A better way to accomplish the same thing is probably to use the feature
<A HREF="h_config_ldap_opts_ref">&quot;Save-Search-Criteria-Not-Result&quot;</A>.

<BODY>
<H1>LDAP FEATURE: Save-Search-Criteria-Not-Result</H1>

Normally when you save the results of an LDAP directory lookup to your
address book the results of the lookup are saved. If this feature is set
and the entry being saved was found on this directory server, then the
search criteria is saved instead of the results of the search. When this
address book entry is used in the future, instead of copying the results
from the address book the directory lookup will be done again. This could
be useful if the copied result might become stale because the data on
the directory server changes (for example, the entry's email address changes).
You probably don't want to set this feature if the server is at all slow or
unreliable.
<P>
The way this actually works is that instead of saving the email address
in your address book, Alpine saves enough information to look up the same
directory entry again. In particular, it saves the server name and the
distinguished name of the entry. It's possible that the server administrators
might change the format of distinguished names on the server, or that the
entry might be removed from the server. If Alpine notices this, you will be warned
and a backup copy of the email address will be used. You may want to create
a new entry in this case, since you will get the annoying warning every
time you use the old entry. You may do that by Saving the entry to a new
nickname in the same address book. You will be asked whether or not you
want to use the backup email address.

<H1>LDAP FEATURE: Disable-Ad-Hoc-Space-Substitution</H1>

Spaces in your input are normally handled specially.
Each space character is replaced
by
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>*&nbsp;&lt;SPACE&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
in the search query (but not by &quot;* &lt;SPACE&gt; *&quot;).
The reason this is done is so the input string
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Greg Donald</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
(which is converted to &quot;Greg* Donald&quot;) will match
the names &quot;Greg Donald&quot;,
&quot;Gregory Donald&quot;, &quot;Greg F. Donald&quot;, and
&quot;Gregory F Donald&quot;; but it won't match &quot;Greg McDonald&quot;.
If the &quot;Search-Rule&quot; you were using was &quot;begins-with&quot;,
then it would also match the name &quot;Greg Donaldson&quot;.
<P>
Turning on this feature will disable this substitution.

<TITLE>LDAP OPTION: Search-Type</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>LDAP OPTION: Search-Type</H1>

This affects the way that LDAP searches are done.
In particular, this tells the server where to look for the string to be matched.
If set to &quot;name&quot; then the string that is being searched for will
be compared with the string in the
&quot;Name&quot; field on the server
(technically, it is the &quot;commonname&quot; field on the server).
&quot;Surname&quot; means we're looking for a
match in the &quot;Surname&quot; field on the
server (actually the &quot;sn&quot; field).
&quot;Givenname&quot; really is &quot;givenname&quot;
and &quot;email&quot; is the electronic mail address (this is actually the field
called &quot;mail&quot; or &quot;electronicmail&quot; on the server).
The other three types are combinations of
the types listed so far. &quot;Name-or-email&quot;
means the string should appear
in either the &quot;name&quot; field OR the &quot;email&quot; field.
Likewise, &quot;surname-or-givenname&quot;
means &quot;surname&quot; OR &quot;givenname&quot;
and &quot;sur-or-given-or-name-or-email&quot; means the obvious thing.
<P>
This search TYPE is combined with the
search <A HREF="h_config_ldap_searchrules">RULE</A>
to form the actual search query.
<P>
The usual default value for this
option is &quot;sur-or-given-or-name-or-email&quot;.
This type of search may be slow on some servers.
Try &quot;name-or-email&quot;, which is often
faster, or just &quot;name&quot; if the performance seems to be a problem.
<P>
Some servers have been configured with different attribute names for
these four fields.
In other words, instead of using the attribute name &quot;mail&quot;
for the email address field, the server might be configured to use something
else, for example, &quot;rfc822mail&quot; or &quot;internetemailaddress&quot;.
Alpine can be configured to use these different attribute names by using
the four configuration options:
<P><UL>
<LI><A HREF="h_config_ldap_email_attr">&quot;EmailAttribute&quot;</A>
</UL>
<P><UL>

&quot;Contains&quot; means that the string you type in

This one is for advanced users only! If you define this, then the

However, the feature
<A HREF="h_config_ldap_opts_nosub">&quot;Disable-Ad-Hoc-Space-Substitution&quot;</A>
is still in effect.
That is, the space substitution will take place even in a custom filter unless
you disable it.
<P>
If your LDAP service stops working and you suspect it might be because
of your custom filter, just delete this filter and try using the
&quot;Search-Type&quot; and &quot;Search-Rule&quot; instead.
Another option that sometimes causes trouble is the
<A HREF="h_config_ldap_base">&quot;Search-Base&quot;</A> option.
<P>
This variable may be set to the string representation of an LDAP search
filter (see RFC1960). In the places where you want the address string to be
substituted in, put a '%s' in this filter string. Here are some examples:
<P>
A &quot;Search-Type&quot; of &quot;name&quot; with &quot;Search-Rule&quot; of &quot;begins-with&quot;
is equivalent to the &quot;Custom-Search-Filter&quot;
<PRE>
     (cn=%s*)
</PRE>
When you try to match against the string &quot;string&quot; the program replaces
the &quot;%s&quot; with &quot;string&quot; (without the quotes). You may have multiple &quot;%s&quot;'s and
they will all be replaced with the string. There is a limit of 10 &quot;%s&quot;'s.
<P>
A &quot;Search-Type&quot; of &quot;name-or-email&quot; with &quot;Search-Rule&quot;
of &quot;contains&quot; is equivalent to
<PRE>
     (|(cn=*%s*)(mail=*%s*))
</PRE>
<P>
If your server uses a different attribute <EM>name</EM> than
Alpine uses by default,
(for example, it uses &quot;rfc822mail&quot; instead of &quot;mail&quot;),
then you may be able to use one or more of the four attribute configuration

<H1>Addressbook Lists</H1>

This is a list of addresses to send to when sending to this address book
entry.  Each member of the list may be an address or another nickname from
any of your address books.  If it is an address, it is OK to include the
full name field as well as the electronic address portion of that address.
For example, the following are all legitimate entries in this field:

<DL><DT>&nbsp;</DT>
<DD>john&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a nickname in your address book)
<DD>jdoe@some.domain
<DD>John Doe &lt;jdoe@some.domain&gt;
</DL>

The addresses should be listed separated by commas, just like you would
enter them from the composer.

<P>

The only difference between a distribution list and a simple entry with a
single address, is that a distribution list has more than one address   
listed in the Addresses: field, whereas a simple personal entry has just  
one address.

<P>

For individual address book entries, if there is a full name in the
Fullname: field (filling in the Fullname: field is not required), it is
used.  If the full name is specified in the Address: field and not in the
Fullname: field, then the full name from the Address: field is used.

<P>

If you type the nickname of a distribution list from one of your address 
books in the Lcc: field, then the full name of that list is used in the  
To: field.  If you put a list in the To: or Cc: fields, that list will be
expanded into all of its addresses.  If the list has a full name, then
that will appear at the beginning of the addresses.

<DL><DT>&nbsp;</DT>
<DD>Sewing Club &lt;john@somewhere&gt;, nancy@something.else, Sal
&lt;sal@here.there&gt;
</DL>

If the first address in the distribution list also has a full name, then
the list full name and that full name are combined into something like the
following:

<DL><DT>&nbsp;</DT>
<DD>Sewing Club -- John Smith &lt;john@somewhere&gt;
</DL>


If you specify a list via Lcc, the full name is used in the To: line.  If
you specify a list in the To: or Cc: fields, then it uses the same method
as for individual entries for filling in the full name.

<H1>&quot;To:&quot; Pattern Explained</H1>

Any text you enter as the &quot;To pattern&quot;
will be compared to the recipients from the To: line of
the message being scored.
When the text you entered matches
all or part of the To: line of a message, then the Score Value
you have specified will be added to the score for the message.
(Any other non-blank parts of the Pattern must match, too.)
<P>

You may enter a complete email address, part of an address, or a
list of addresses or partial addresses.
For example:
<P>

<PRE>
 To pattern = friend@public.com

 To pattern = rated.net

 To pattern = xxx@adults.com
              admin@msn.com
              fool@motleyfool.com
</PRE>

<P>
Each of those are valid To patterns.
<P>

Messages match those patterns if any of the
addresses in the To: line of the message contains the pattern.
If the pattern is a list of patterns
(like the last example above) then it is a match if any of the patterns in
the list match any of the addresses in the To: line.
(It is not possible to specify two addresses that must <EM>BOTH</EM> be
present for a match.
It is only possible to specify that <EM>EITHER</EM> address1 <EM>OR</EM>
address2 must be present.
That is exactly what using a list does.)
<P>

Some messages may be &quot;bounced&quot; to you, and will
have a &quot;Resent-To:&quot; header line.
If the message contains a Resent-To: line
and the feature <A HREF="h_config_use_resentto"><!--#echo var="FEAT_use-resent-to-in-rules"--></A> is turned on,
Alpine will look for
matches to your &quot;To patterns&quot; there, and <EM>NOT</EM> in
the original To: line.
<P>

When entering a pattern, you may choose an address from your address book
with the &quot;T&quot; command.
<P>

It is possible to add a <EM>NOT</EM> to the To Pattern meaning with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
This changes the meaning of the To pattern so that it has the opposite meaning.
It will be considered a match if there are no matches between the
addresses in the To: line and the list of To patterns.
<P>
Don't make the mistake of putting the &quot;!&quot; in the data field for
the pattern.
For example, if you type the characters &quot;!frizzle&quot; into the To
pattern, the pattern will look like:
<P>
<PRE>
 To pattern = !frizzle
</PRE>
<P>
This means you want to match the 8 character sequence &quot;!frizzle&quot;.
In order to match messages that do not have &quot;frizzle&quot; in
their To field, first type the characters &quot;frizzle&quot; followed
by carriage return for the value of the To pattern, then negate it
by typing the &quot;!&quot; command.
It should end up looking like
<P>
<PRE>
 ! To pattern = frizzle
</PRE>
<P>
You are not limited to using the six standard header patterns that are
normally shown (To, From, Sender, Cc, News, and Subject).
You may add any other header to a Pattern by
using the &quot;eXtraHdr&quot; command to specify a different
message header line; and then the Add or Change command to fill in
a pattern for the new header line, just like you would for a standard header.
<P>
A technicality: Since comma is the character used to separate multiple
values in a pattern field, you have to escape comma with a backslash (&#92;) if
you want to include a literal comma in the field.
In other words, if you type a backslash followed by a comma it will
be interpreted as a comma by Alpine, instead of as a separator between
pattern values.
All other backslashes are literal backslashes and should not be escaped.

In other words, if you type a backslash followed by a comma it will
be interpreted as a comma by Alpine, instead of as a separator between
pattern values.
All other backslashes are literal backslashes and should not be escaped.

<H1>&quot;To:&quot; Pattern Explained</H1>

Any text you enter as the &quot;To pattern&quot;
will be compared to the recipients from the To: line of
messages when Alpine opens folders.
When the text you entered matches
all or part of the To: line of a message, then the Filter Action you have
specified will be carried out.
(Any other non-blank parts of the Pattern must match, too.)
<P>

You may enter a complete email address, part of an address, or a
list of addresses or partial addresses.
For example:
<P>

<PRE>
 To pattern = friend@public.com
 To pattern = rated.net
 To pattern = xxx@adults.com
              admin@msn.com
              fool@motleyfool.com
</PRE>

<P>
Each of those are valid To patterns.
<P>

Messages match those patterns if any of the
addresses in the To: line of the message contains the pattern.
If the pattern is a list of patterns
(like the last example above) then it is a match if any of the patterns in
the list match any of the addresses in the To: line.
(It is not possible to specify two addresses that must <EM>BOTH</EM> be
present for a match.
It is only possible to specify that <EM>EITHER</EM> address1 <EM>OR</EM>
address2 must be present.
That is exactly what using a list does.)
<P>

Some messages may be &quot;bounced&quot; to you, and will
have a &quot;Resent-To:&quot; header line.
If the message contains a Resent-To: line
and the feature <A HREF="h_config_use_resentto"><!--#echo var="FEAT_use-resent-to-in-rules"--></A> is turned on,
Alpine will look for
matches to your &quot;To patterns&quot; there, and <EM>NOT</EM> in
the original To: line.
<P>

When entering a pattern, you may choose an address from your address book
with the &quot;T&quot; command.
<P>

It is possible to add a <EM>NOT</EM> to the To Pattern meaning with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
This changes the meaning of the To pattern so that it has the opposite meaning.
It will be considered a match if there are no matches between the
addresses in the To: line and the list of To patterns.
<P>
Don't make the mistake of putting the &quot;!&quot; in the data field for
the pattern.
For example, if you type the characters &quot;!frizzle&quot; into the To
pattern, the pattern will look like:
<P>
<PRE>
 To pattern = !frizzle
</PRE>
<P>
This means you want to match the 8 character sequence &quot;!frizzle&quot;.
In order to match messages that do not have &quot;frizzle&quot; in
their To field, first type the characters &quot;frizzle&quot; followed
by carriage return for the value of the To pattern, then negate it
by typing the &quot;!&quot; command.
It should end up looking like
<P>
<PRE>
 ! To pattern = frizzle
</PRE>
<P>

You are not limited to using the six standard header patterns that are
normally shown (To, From, Sender, Cc, News, and Subject).
You may add any other header to a Pattern by
using the &quot;eXtraHdr&quot; command to specify a different
message header line; and then the Add or Change command to fill in
a pattern for the new header line, just like you would for a standard header.
<P>
A technicality: Since comma is the character used to separate multiple
values in a pattern field, you have to escape comma with a backslash (&#92;) if

<H1>Character Set Pattern Explained</H1>

A message may use one or more character sets.
This part of the Pattern matches messages that make use of
certain specified character sets.
It will be considered a match if a message uses any of the character
sets in the list you give here.

<P>
When filling in a value for this field, you may use
the &quot;T&quot; command, which presents you with a large list of
possible character sets to choose from.
You may also just type in the name of a character set, and it need not
be one that Alpine knows about.

<P>
Besides actual character set names (for example, ISO-8859-7, KOI8-R, or
GB2312) you may also use some shorthand names that Alpine provides.
These names are more understandable shorthand names for sets of 
character set names.
Two examples are &quot;Cyrillic&quot; and &quot;Greek&quot;.
Selecting one of these shorthand names is equivalent to selecting all of
the character sets that make up the set.
You can see all of these shorthand names and the lists of character sets
they stand for by typing the &quot;T&quot; command.

<P>
For the purposes of this Pattern,
Alpine will search through a message for all of the text parts and
collect the character sets declared for each part.
It will also look in the Subject line for a character set used there.
Alpine does not actually look at the text of the message or the text
of the Subject to determine if a declared character set is actually
used, it looks only at the declarations themselves in the MIME part headers
and in the Subject.

<P>
It is possible to add a <EM>NOT</EM> to the Character Set Pattern meaning with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
This changes the meaning of the Character Set pattern so that
it has the opposite meaning.
It will be considered a match if none of the character sets in the
list are used in a message.
<P>
Don't make the mistake of putting the &quot;!&quot; in the data field for
the pattern.
For example, if you type the characters &quot;!GB2312&quot; into the
Character Set pattern, the pattern will look like:
<P>
<PRE>
 Charset pattern = !GB2312
</PRE>
<P>
This means you want to match the 7 character sequence &quot;!GB2312&quot;.
In order to match messages that do not have the
character set &quot;GB2312&quot;
set, first type the characters &quot;GB2312&quot; followed
by carriage return for the value of the Character Set pattern, then negate it
by typing the &quot;!&quot; command.
It should end up looking like

<H1>Keyword Pattern Explained</H1>

A folder may have user-defined keywords.
These are similar to the Important flag, which the user may set using the
Flag command.
The difference is that the Important flag is always present for each folder.
User-defined keywords are picked by the user.
You may add new keywords by defining them in the
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A> option in the Setup/Config screen.
After you have added a potential keyword with the <!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--> option,
the Flag command may be used to set or clear the keyword on individual messages.
If you have given a keyword a nickname when configuring it,
that nickname may be used instead of the actual keyword.

<P>
When filling in a value for this field, it may be easiest to use
the &quot;T&quot; command, which presents you with a list of the keywords
you have defined to choose from.

<P>
This part of the Pattern matches messages with certain keywords set.
It will be considered a match if a message has any of the keywords in the
list set.
A keyword that you have not defined using the
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A> option in the Setup/Config screen
will not be a match.

<P>
It is possible to add a <EM>NOT</EM> to the Keyword Pattern meaning with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
This changes the meaning of the Keyword pattern so that it has the opposite meaning.
It will be considered a match if none of the keywords in the list are set
for a message.
A keyword that you have not defined using the

will not be a match, so a <EM>NOT</EM> of that keyword does match.
<P>
Don't make the mistake of putting the &quot;!&quot; in the data field for
the pattern.
For example, if you type the characters &quot;!frizzle&quot; into the Keyword
pattern, the pattern will look like:
<P>
<PRE>
 Keyword pattern = !frizzle
</PRE>
<P>
This means you want to match the 8 character sequence &quot;!frizzle&quot;.
In order to match messages that do not have the keyword &quot;frizzle&quot;
set, first type the characters &quot;frizzle&quot; followed
by carriage return for the value of the Keyword pattern, then negate it
by typing the &quot;!&quot; command.
It should end up looking like
<P>
<PRE>
 ! Keyword pattern = frizzle
</PRE>
<P>
A technicality: Since comma is the character used to separate multiple
values in a pattern field, you have to escape comma with a backslash (&#92;) if
you want to include a literal comma in the field.
In other words, if you type a backslash followed by a comma it will
be interpreted as a comma by Alpine, instead of as a separator between
pattern values.
All other backslashes are literal backslashes and should not be escaped.

<H1>Extra Header Patterns Explained</H1>

The header patterns that come after the Participant pattern but before the 
AllText pattern are extra header patterns that you have added to a rule's
Pattern. These are just like the other header patterns except that
the contents of the particular header listed on the left hand side will
be used for comparisons.
<P>
The &quot;eXtraHdr&quot; command may be used to add more of these
header patterns to the rule you are editing.
<P>
The &quot;RemoveHdr&quot; command may be used to delete the highlighted
extra header pattern from the rule you are editing.
<P>
It is possible to add a <EM>NOT</EM> to the Extra Header Pattern meaning with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
This changes the meaning of the pattern so that it has the opposite meaning.
It will be considered a match if there are no matches between the
text in the header line and the list of patterns.
<P>
Don't make the mistake of putting the &quot;!&quot; in the data field for
the pattern.
For example, if you type the characters &quot;!frizzle&quot; into the
pattern, the pattern will look like:
<P>
<PRE>
 Xyz pattern = !frizzle
</PRE>
<P>
This means you want to match the 8 character sequence &quot;!frizzle&quot;.
In order to match messages that do not have &quot;frizzle&quot; in
their Xyz field, first type the characters &quot;frizzle&quot; followed
by carriage return for the value of the pattern, then negate it
by typing the &quot;!&quot; command.
It should end up looking like
<P>
<PRE>
 ! Xyz pattern = frizzle

<H1>Categorizer Command Explained</H1>

This is a command that is run with its standard input set to the message
being checked and its standard output discarded.
The full directory path should be specified.
The command will be run and then its exit status will be checked against
the Exit Status Interval, which defaults to just the value zero.
If the exit status of the command falls in the interval, it is considered
a match, otherwise it is not a match.
<P>

This option may actually be a list of commands.
The first one that exists and is executable is used.
That makes it possible to use the same configuration with Unix Alpine and
PC-Alpine.
<P>

If none of the commands in the list exists and is executable then the rule
is <EM>not</EM> a match.
If it is possible that the command may not exist, you should be careful
to structure your rules so that nothing destructive
happens when the command does not exist.
For example, you might have a filter that filters away spam when there is
a match but does nothing when there is not a match.
That would cause no harm if the command didn't exist.
However, if you have a filter that filters away spam when there is not
a match and keeps it when there is a match, that would filter everything
if the categorizer command didn't exist.

<H1>Categorizer Command Example</H1>

Bogofilter
(<A HREF="http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/">http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/</A>)
is a mail filter that attempts to classify mail as spam or
non-spam using statistical analysis of the message content.
When run with no arguments and a message as standard input, it exits with
exit status 0 if it thinks a message is spam and 1 if it thinks
it is not spam.
To use bogofilter as your Categorizer Command you would simply set Command to
the pathname of the bogofilter program.
For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Command = /usr/local/bin/bogofilter</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Exit status of zero is what you are interested in, so you'd set the
Exit Status Interval to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Exit Status Interval = (0,0)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

In order to prevent downloading an entire huge message to check for spam, you
might want to set the Character Limit to a few thousand characters (the
assumption being that the spam will reveal itself in those characters)
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Character Limit = 50000</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

You would probably use bogofilter in an Alpine Filter Rule, and have the action
be to move the message to a spam folder.
It would usually be wise to also check the &quot;Message is Recent&quot;
part of the rule so that messages are only checked when they first arrive,
and to restrict the Current Folder Type to just your INBOX.
The reason for checking only Recent messages is to save the time it takes
to run bogofilter on each message.
As an experiment, you might start out by using this in an Indexcolor Rule
instead of a Filter Rule.
In that case, you probably wouldn't check the Recent checkbox.
<P>
The use described above assumes that you are somehow maintaining bogofilter's
database of words associated with spam and non-spam messages.
One way to start your database would be to select a bunch of spam messages
in Alpine (you might Save spam messages to a special folder or use Alpine's
Select command to select several) and then Apply
(<A HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops"><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-aggregate-command-set"--></A>)
a pipe command to the spam messages.
For example, you could have a shell script or an alias
called <EM>this_is_spam</EM>, which would simply be the command
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>bogofilter -s</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

It is probably best to use the pipe command's Raw Text, With Delimiter,
and Free Output options,
which are at the bottom of the screen when you type the pipe command.
That's because bogofilter expects the raw message as input, and uses
the Delimiters to tell when a new message starts.
You would not need to use a separate pipe for each message, because
bogofilter can handle multiple messages at once.
<P>
Similarly, you would select a group of non-spam messages
and run them through a <EM>this_is_nonspam</EM> script
that was something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>bogofilter -n</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

For the more adventurous, the next step might be to automate the upkeep of
the bogofilter database.
It might make more sense to have bogofilter be part of the delivery process,
but it is also possible to do it entirely from within Alpine.
Instead of using just plain &quot;bogofilter&quot; as the Categorizer Command,
the &quot;-u&quot; argument will cause bogofilter to update the database.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Command = /usr/local/bin/bogofilter -u</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
You'd want a couple more aliases or shell scripts called something like
<EM>change_to_spam</EM>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>bogofilter -Ns</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and
<EM>change_to_nonspam</EM>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>bogofilter -Sn</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
When you run across a message in your INBOX that should have been
classified as spam you would pipe it to the change_to_spam script, and
when you run across a message in your spam folder that should have been
left in your INBOX you would pipe it through change_to_nonspam.

<P>
There is a technical problem with this approach.
Alpine may check your filters more than once.
In particular, every time you start Alpine the filters will be checked for
each message.
Also, if you have any filters that depend on message state (New, Deleted, etc.)
then Alpine will recheck for matches in messages that have changed state
at the time you close the folder and before expunging.
This is usually ok.
However, in this case it is a problem because the command
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Command = /usr/local/bin/bogofilter -u</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
has the side effect of updating the database.
So you run the risk of updating the database multiple times for a single
message instead of updating it just once per message.
There are some ways to work around this problem.
What you need is a way to mark the message after you have run the filter.
One way to mark messages is with the use of a keyword (say &quot;Bogo&quot;).
Besides having the filter move the message to a spam folder, also have it
set the Bogo keyword.
(Note that you will have to set up the &quot;Bogo&quot; keyword in the
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A> option in Setup/Config.)
This rule can only set the Bogo keyword for the messages that it matches.
You will also need to add a second rule right after this one that
matches all the messages that don't have the Bogo keyword set
(put the keyword in the Keyword pattern and toggle
the Not with the ! command)
and takes the action of setting it.
Then change the &quot;bogofilter -u&quot; rule so that it won't be a match
(and so it won't re-run the bogofilter command) if the keyword is already
set.
<P>
What you will end up with is a rule that runs &quot;bogofilter -u&quot;
on all messages that don't have the Bogo keyword set.
This will have the side effect of inserting that message in the bogofilter
database, match or not.
If this rule matches (it is spam), the Bogo keyword will be set and
the message will be moved to a spam folder.
If it does not match, the
following rule will mark the message by turning on the keyword.
This second rule should be a non-terminating
(<A HREF="h_config_filt_opts_nonterm">Dont-Stop-Even-if-Rule-Matches</A>)
rule so that it doesn't stop the filtering process before the rest of
your rules are consulted.

<P>
In summary, the first rule is something like
<PRE>
  Nickname          = bogofilter -u rule
  Current Folder Type =
               (*) Specific
                   Folder = INBOX

  ! Keyword pattern = Bogo

  External Categorizer Commands =
       Command              = /usr/local/bin/bogofilter -u
       Exit Status Interval = (0,0)
       Character Limit      = <No Value Set: using "-1">  (optionally set this)

  Filter Action =
       (*) Move
           Folder = spam
  
  Set These Keywords   = Bogo
</PRE>
<P>
and the following rule is
<PRE>
  Nickname          = Set Bogo Keyword
  Current Folder Type =
               (*) Specific
                   Folder = INBOX

  ! Keyword pattern = Bogo

  Filter Action =
       (*) Just Set Message Status

  Set These Keywords   = Bogo

  Features =
      [X]  dont-stop-even-if-rule-matches
</PRE>
<P>
If it is possible for you to insert bogofilter in the delivery process instead
of having it called from Alpine you could prevent having to wait
for the bogofilter processing while you read your mail.
You would have bogofilter add a header to the message at the time of delivery
that identified it as spam or nonspam.
With this method, you could avoid using a Categorizer Command while running Alpine,
and just match on the header instead.
You might still want to use the scripts mentioned above to initialize the
database or to re-classify wrongly classified messages.

<P>
Finally, it isn't for the faint-hearted,
but it is also possible to run bogofilter from PC-Alpine.
You can install Cygwin from
<A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</A> and
then compile bogofilter in the cygwin environment, and run it from
within PC-Alpine.
You would end up with a Categorizer command that looked something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Command = C:&#92;cygwin&#92;bin&#92;bogofilter.exe -u</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Note that the &quot;.exe&quot; extension is explicit,
and that the bogofilter.exe executable should be in the same directory
as cygwin1.dll.

The categorizer command is run and the result is the exit status of
that command.
If that exit status falls in the Exit Status Interval
then it is considered a match, otherwise it is not a match.
Of course for the entire rule to match, it must also be checked against
the other defined parts of the Pattern.
<P>
The Exit Status Interval defaults to the single value 0 (zero).
If you define it, it should be set to something like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_exit_value,max_exit_value)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_exit_value&quot; and &quot;max_exit_value&quot; are integers.
The special values &quot;INF&quot; and &quot;-INF&quot; may be used for large
positive and negative integers.
<P>
Actually, a list of intervals may be used if you wish.
A list would look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_exit_value1,max_exit_value1),(min_exit_value2,max_exit_value2),...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
When there is an Exit Status Interval defined, it is a match if the exit status
of the categorizer command is contained in any of the intervals.
The intervals include both endpoints.

When there is an Age Interval defined, it is a match if the age, in days, of

The interval includes both endpoints.
If the option is set to a list of intervals then it is a match if the
age of the message is contained in any of the intervals.
<P>
Even though this option is called Age, it isn't actually
the <EM>age</EM> of the message.
Instead, it is how many days ago the message arrived in one of your folders.
If the current time is a little past midnight, then a message that arrived
just before midnight arrived yesterday, even though the message is only
a few minutes old.
By default, the date being used is not the date in the Date
header of the message.
It is the date that the message arrived in one of your folders.
When you Save a message from one folder to another that arrival date
is preserved.
If you would like to use the date in the Date header that is possible.
Turn on the option
<A HREF="h_config_filt_opts_sentdate">&quot;Use-Date-Header-For-Age&quot;</A>

A value of 0 is today, 1 is yesterday, 2 is the day before yesterday, and so on.
The age interval

<H1>Current Folder Type Explained</H1>

The Current Folder Type is part of the role's Pattern.
It refers to the type of the currently open folder, which is the folder
you were last looking at from the MESSAGE INDEX or MESSAGE TEXT screen.
In order for a role to be considered a match, the current folder must
be of the type you set here.
The three types &quot;Any&quot;, &quot;News&quot;, and &quot;Email&quot; are
all what you might think.
<P>
If the Current Folder Type for a role's Pattern is set to &quot;News&quot;, for
example, then
that role will only be a match if the current folder is a newsgroup and
the rest of the Pattern matches.
The value &quot;Specific&quot; may be used when you want to limit the match
to a specific folder (not just a specific type of folder), or to a list of
specific folders.
<P>
In order to match a specific folder you Select the &quot;Specific&quot;
button <EM>AND</EM> fill in
the name (or list of names) of
the folder in the &quot;Folder List&quot; field.
If the current folder is any of the folders in the list, that is considered
a match.
The name of each folder in the list may be either &quot;INBOX&quot;,
the technical specification
of the folder (like what appears in your configuration file) or, if the
folder is one of your incoming folders, it may be the nickname you've given
the folder.
Here are a couple samples of specific folder names:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{monet.art.example.com/user=vincent}mail/art-class</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{news.example.com/nntp/user=peter}#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Observe that in order for an external folder (IMAP, POP, News) to be a match,
you must also add the /user= option in the definition of the incoming folder.
<P>
The easiest way to fill in the &quot;Folder List&quot; field is to use
the &quot;T&quot; command that is available when the &quot;Folder List&quot; line is
highlighted, or to use the &quot;Take&quot; command with the configuration
feature
<A HREF="h_config_enable_role_take">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-rules-under-take"-->&quot;</A>
turned on.
Note that you won't be able to edit the &quot;Folder List&quot; line unless the
Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Specific&quot;, and any value that
&quot;Folder List&quot; has is ignored unless the type
is set to &quot;Specific&quot;.
<P>
When reading a newsgroup, there may be a performance penalty
incurred when collecting the information necessary to check a Pattern.
For this reason, the default Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Email&quot;.

labeled &quot;Just Set Message Status&quot;) then the message status
setting will happen

If you are Moving a message you may also set Message Status if you wish.

The easiest way to fill in the &quot;Folder List&quot; field is to use
the T command that is available when the &quot;Folder List&quot; line is

<P>
There are a few tokens that may be used in the names in the Folder List.
They are all related to the date on which the filtering is taking place.
The tokens are words surrounded by underscores.
For example, if you want your filter to move messages to a folder named
<P><CENTER><SAMP>abc-year-mon</SAMP></CENTER><P>
you could specify the folder as
<P><CENTER><SAMP>abc-_CURYEAR_-_CURMONTHABBREV_</SAMP></CENTER><P>
which would result in a file named something like
<P><CENTER><SAMP>abc-2004-oct</SAMP></CENTER><P>
or
<P><CENTER><SAMP>abc-_CURYEAR2DIGIT_-_CURMONTH2DIGIT_</SAMP></CENTER><P>
which would result in a file named something like
<P><CENTER><SAMP>abc-04-10</SAMP></CENTER><P>

<H1>Current Folder Type Explained</H1>

The Current Folder Type is part of the scoring rule's Pattern.
It refers to the type of the folder that
the message being scored is in.
In order for a rule to be considered a match, the current folder must
be of the type you set here.
The three types &quot;Any&quot;, &quot;News&quot;, and &quot;Email&quot; are
all what you might think.
<P>
If the Current Folder Type for a Pattern is set to &quot;News&quot;, for
example, then
that Pattern will only match if the current folder is a newsgroup and
the rest of the Pattern matches.
The value &quot;Specific&quot; may be used when you want to limit the match
to a specific folder (not just a specific type of folder), or to a list of
specific folders.
<P>
In order to match a specific folder you Select the &quot;Specific&quot;
button <EM>AND</EM> fill in
the name (or list of names) of
the folder in the &quot;Folder List&quot; field.
If the current folder is any of the folders in the list, that is considered
a match.
The name of each folder in the list may be either &quot;INBOX&quot;, the technical specification
of the folder (like what appears in your configuration file) or, if the
folder is one of your incoming folders, it may be the nickname you've given
the folder.
Here are a couple samples of specific folder names:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{monet.art.example.com}mail/art-class</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{news.example.com/nntp}#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The easiest way to fill in the &quot;Folder List&quot; field is to use

Note that you won't be able to edit the &quot;Folder List&quot; line unless the
Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Specific&quot;, and any value that
&quot;Folder List&quot; has is ignored unless the type
is set to &quot;Specific&quot;.
<P>
When reading a newsgroup, there may be a performance penalty
incurred when collecting the information necessary to check a Pattern.
For this reason, the default Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Email&quot;.
For example, if you have Index Line Coloring rules that have Score Intervals
defined then the scores for all the visible messages will need to be calculated.
If some of your Scoring rules have 
a Current Folder Type of
&quot;Any&quot; or &quot;News&quot; this may cause the MESSAGE INDEX
screen to draw more slowly when in a newsgroup.

This option gives you a way to match messages that contain an address
that is in one of your address books.
Only the simple entries in your address books are searched.
Address book distribution lists are ignored!
<P>
This part of the Pattern may have one of five possible values.
The default value is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which matches any message.
The value &quot;Yes, in any address book&quot; means at least one of the addresses
from the message must be in at least one of your
address books in order to be a match.
The value &quot;No, not in any address book&quot;
means none of the addresses may
be in any of your address books in order to be a match.
<P>
The values &quot;Yes, in specific address books&quot; and
&quot;No, not in any of specific address books&quot; are similar but instead
of depending on all address books you are allowed to give a list of address
books to look in.
Usually this would be a single address book but it may be a
list of address books as well.
For each of these &quot;specific&quot; address book options you Select which
of the Specific options you want (Yes or No) <EM>AND</EM> fill in the
name (or list of names) of the address book in the
&quot;Abook List&quot; field.
The names to be used are those that appear in the ADDRESS BOOK LIST screen.
The easiest way to fill in the Abook List field it to use
the &quot;T&quot; command that is available when the &quot;Abook List&quot;
line is highlighted.
Note that you won't be able to edit the &quot;Abook List&quot; line unless the
option is set to one of the two &quot;Specific&quot;, values.
<P>
The addresses from the message that are checked for are determined by the
setting you have for &quot;Types of addresses to check for in address book&quot;.
If you set this to &quot;From&quot; the From address from the message will
be looked up in the address book.
If you set it to &quot;To&quot; instead then the To addresses will be used.
If any of the To addresses are in the address book then it is considered
a match for &quot;Yes&quot; or not a match for &quot;No&quot;.
You could set it to both From and To, in which case all of the From and To
addresses are used.
The &quot;Reply-To&quot; and &quot;Sender&quot; cases are a little unusual.
Due to deficiencies in our tools, Reply-To uses the Reply-To address if it
exists or the From address if there is no Reply-To address.
Same for the Sender address.

Here are some technical details.
The way that Alpine decides if it is the beginning of the month or not is
to compare today's date with the date stored in the
<A HREF="h_config_prune_date"><!--#echo var="VAR_last-time-prune-questioned"--></A>
variable in the config file.
If the month of today's date is later than the month stored in the variable,
then this is considered to be the first time you have run Alpine this month, and
that turns the Beginning of the Month option on.

same as whether or not this is the first time a paricular folder has been
opened this year.
If you want some action (probably Filtering) to take place in a folder each
year, then you will need to be sure that the folder is opened during the
first Alpine session of the year in order for this option to be helpful.
<P>
This part of the Pattern may have one of three possible values.
The default value is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which matches any message.
The other two values are &quot;Yes&quot;, which means this is the first
time Alpine has been run this year;
or &quot;No&quot;, which
means this is not the first time Alpine has been run this year.
<P>
Look &quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;
for more information on Patterns.
<P>
Here are some technical details.
The way that Alpine decides if it is the beginning of the year or not is
to compare today's date with the date stored in the
<A HREF="h_config_prune_date"><!--#echo var="VAR_last-time-prune-questioned"--></A>
variable in the config file.
If the year of today's date is later than the year stored in the variable,
then this is considered to be the first time you have run Alpine this year, and
that turns the Beginning of the Year option on.

<H1>Initialize Values From Role Explained</H1>

This is a power user feature.
You will usually want to leave this field empty.
The value of this field is the nickname of another one of your roles.
The Action values from that other role
are used as the initial values of the Action items for this role.
If you put something in any of the action fields for this role, that will
override whatever was in the corresponding field of the initializer role.
<P>
You might use this field if the &quot;Action&quot; part of one of your roles
is something you want to use in more than one role.
Instead of filling in those action values again for each role, you
may give the nickname of the role where the values are filled in.
It's just a shortcut way to define Role Actions.
<P>
Here's an example to help explain how this works.
Suppose you have a role with nickname &quot;role1&quot; and role1 has
(among other things)
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Set Reply-To = The Pres &lt;president@example.com&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
set.
If in &quot;role2&quot; you set &quot;Initialize settings using role&quot; to
&quot;role1&quot;, then role2 will inherit the Set Reply-To value
from role1 by default (and any of the other inheritable action values
that are set).
So if role2 had
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Set Reply-To = &lt;No Value Set&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
defined, the Reply-To used with role2 would be &quot;The Pres &lt;president@example.com&gt;&quot;
However, if role2 had
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Set Reply-To = VP &lt;vicepresident@example.com&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
defined, then the Reply-To used with role2 would be &quot;VP &lt;vicepresident@example.com&gt;&quot; instead.
<P>
If you wish,
you may choose a nickname from your list of roles by using the
&quot;T&quot; command.
If the role you are using to initialize also has a role it initializes from,
then that initialization happens first.
That is, inheritance works as expected with the grandparent and
great-grandparent (and so on) roles having the expected effect.

This describes part of the action to be taken if the Pattern for this

This field gives you a way to set values for headers besides
&quot;From&quot; and &quot;Reply-To&quot;.
If you want to set either of those, use the specific
&quot;Set From&quot; and &quot;Set Reply-To&quot; settings above.
<P>
This field is similar to the
"<A HREF="h_config_custom_hdrs"><!--#echo var="VAR_customized-hdrs"--></A>" option.
Each header you specify here must include the header tag 
(&quot;To:&quot;, &quot;Approved:&quot;, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.
In order to see these headers when you compose using this role you 
must use the rich header
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->(F5)
<!--chtml else-->(Ctrl-R)<!--chtml endif--> command.
Here's an example that shows how you might set the To address.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Set Other Hdrs = To: Full Name &lt;user@domain&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Headers set in this way are different from headers set with the
<!--#echo var="VAR_customized-hdrs"--> option in that the value you give for a header here
will replace any value that already exists.
For example, if you are Replying to a message there will already be at
least one address in the To header (the address you are Replying to).
However, if you Reply using a role that sets the To header, that role's
To header value will be used instead.
<P>
Limitation: Because commas are used to separate the list of
Other Headers, it is not possible to have the value of a
header contain a comma;
nor is there currently an &quot;escape&quot; mechanism provided
to make this work.

You may either use all Literal Signatures (signatures stored in your

You can't mix the two.
<P>
This field consists of a filename that will be used as the signature
file when using this role.
<P>
If the filename is followed by a vertical bar (|) then instead
of reading the contents of the file the file is assumed to be a
program that will produce the text to be used on its standard output.
The program can't have any arguments and doesn't receive any input from Alpine,
but the rest of the processing works as if the contents came from a file.
<P>
Instead of storing the data in a local file, the
signature data may be stored remotely in an IMAP folder.
In order to do this, 
you must use a remote name for the signature.
A remote signature name might look like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us}mail/sig3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

The syntax used here is the same as the syntax used for a remote
<A HREF="h_config_signature_file"><!--#echo var="VAR_signature-file"--></A>.
Note that you may not access an existing signature file remotely,
you have to create a new <EM>folder</EM> that contains the signature data.
If the name you use here for the signature data is a remote name, then when
you edit the file using the &quot;F&quot; command the data will
be saved remotely in the folder.
You aren't required to do anything special to create the folder, it
gets created if you use a remote name.

<P>
If you type &quot;F&quot; you may edit the contents of the file (as opposed to
the name of the file) you have specified.
If you type &quot;T&quot; you may use a browser to choose an existing filename.
<P>
Besides containing regular text, a signature file may also
contain (or a signature program may produce) tokens that are replaced with text
that depends on the message you are replying to or forwarding.
The tokens all look like _word_ (a word surrounded by underscores).
For example, if the token
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
is included in the text of the signature file, then when you reply to
or forward a message, the token will be replaced with the actual date
the message you are replying to or forwarding was sent.
<P>
If you use a role that has a signature file for a plain composition
(that is, not a reply or forward) then there is no original message, so
any tokens that depend on the message will be replaced with nothing.
So if you want a signature file to be useful for new compositions it
shouldn't include any of the tokens that depend on the message being
replied to or forwarded.
<P>
The list of available tokens is
<A HREF="h_index_tokens">here</A>.
<P>
Actually, for the adventurous, there is a way to conditionally include text based
on whether or not a token would result in specific replacement text.
For example, you could include some text based on whether or not
the _NEWS_ token would result in any newsgroups if it was used.
It's explained in detail
<A HREF="h_reply_token_conditionals">here</A>.
<P>
In the very unlikely event that you want to include a literal token in
a signature file, you must precede it with a backslash character.
For example, to include the literal text _DATE_ you must actually use
&#92;_DATE_.
It is not possible to have a literal backslash followed by an expanded token.
<P>
A blank field here means that Alpine will use its normal rules for deciding
which file (if any) to use for the signature file.

For example, if you type the Expunge command, this filter is applied
before the expunge, so matching messages will be marked Deleted and then
will be permanently expunged from the folder.
However, since the index isn't redrawn in between the time that the message
is marked Deleted and the time that you are asked to expunge, the only
indication that you are expunging the message comes in the number of messages
being expunged.
The same thing may happen when you close a folder.

<H1>Score Value From Header Explained</H1>

This option provides a way to use a number that appears in the headers of your
messages as the message's score, or as a component of that score.
If this field is defined then it is used instead of the &quot;Score Value&quot;.
The idea behind this option is that there may be a score embedded in the
headers of messages that has already been calculated outside of Alpine.
For example, messages delivered to you may contain an &quot;X-Spam&quot; header and
somewhere in that header there is a score.
<P>
The value for this option is the name of the header followed by parentheses
with two arguments inside:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>HeaderName(field_number,field_separators)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
No space is allowed between the comma and the start of the field_separators.
It would be interpreted as the first separator if it was there.
Field 0 is the whole line, Field 1 is the data up to the first separator, Field 2
starts after that and goes to the second separator, and so on.
It's easier to explain with examples.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>X-Spam(2,&quot;&nbsp;&quot;)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
In the above example the header that is used is the &quot;X-Spam&quot; header.
The value of that header (the part after the colon and the space) is split
into fields separated by spaces.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Field1 &lt;space&gt; Field2 &lt;space&gt; Field3 ...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The second field is selected and converted to an integer. It only makes sense
if Field2 really is an integer.
<P>
Here's an example of a SpamAssassin header.
The exact look of the header will vary, but if your incoming mail
contains headers that look like the following
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>X-Spam-Status: Yes, hits=10.6 tagged_above=-999.0 required=7.0 tests=BAYE...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
you might want to use the hits value as a score.
Since the score is an integer value you can't make use of the decimal part of
the number, but
you might split off the hits=10 part as a score by using the characters &quot;=&quot;
and &quot;.&quot; as your separators.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>X-Spam-Status(2,&quot;=.&quot;)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The first field starts with the Y in Yes and goes until the &quot;=&quot; after
hits.
The second field is &quot;10&quot; so the score value would be 10.
<P>
Another example we've seen has headers that look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>X-Spam: Gauge=IIIIIII, Probability=7%, Report=...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Because there are two equals before the 7% the value
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>X-Spam(3,&quot;=%&quot;)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
should capture the probability as the score.
<P>
The Score From Header scoring value actually works just like the
regular Score Value in that the rest of the pattern has to match before
it is used and the scores from all the different scoring rules that
match for a particular message are added together.
When using the Score From Header method it may (or may not) make sense to
use only a single scoring rule with a pattern that matches every message.

If there is a match then this role will either be used without confirmation

If confirmation is requested, you will also have a chance to

This option determines how this particular role will be used when Composing

This does not affect what happens when using the &quot;Role&quot; command
to compose a new message.
The &quot;Role&quot; command allows you to select a role from all of the
roles you have defined, regardless of what Uses you've assigned to those
roles.
<P>

There are three possible values for this option.
The value &quot;Never&quot;
means that this role will not be a candidate for use when Composing.
The role's Current Folder Type will not be checked for a match, however the role
will be available to be manually switched to if there is a confirmation prompt.
<P>

The options &quot;With confirmation&quot; and &quot;Without confirmation&quot;
mean that you do want to consider this role when Composing.
For either of these settings,
the role's Current Folder Type will be checked (since there is no message
to compare with, the rest of the Pattern is considered a match).
If there is a match then this role will either be used without confirmation
or will be the default when confirmation is asked for, depending on
which of the two options is selected.
If confirmation is requested, you will also have a chance to
manually change the role to any one of your other roles.
<P>

When using the Compose command the role checking is a little different
because there is no message being replied to or forwarded.
Because of this the Current Folder Type is checked but the header pattern
fields, the AllText pattern, the BodyText pattern, and the Score Interval are all ignored.
A role is considered to be a match if it is a candidate for Compose Use and
its Current Folder Type matches the currently open folder.
This could be useful if you want to set a role based on the folder you
are reading, or the type of folder you are reading.

<DT>SMARTDATE alternatives</DT>
<DD>
There are several versions of SMARTDATE that are all the same except
for the way they format dates far in the past.
SMARTDATE formats the date using the information from your locale settings
to format the date string. It may end up formatting dates so that they look
like DATEISO tokens, or SHORTDATE2 tokens, or something else entirely.
The feature
<A HREF="h_config_dates_to_local"><!--#echo var="FEAT_convert-dates-to-localtime"--></A>

the Regional Options control panel may be used to set the Short date

For example, &quot;23rd&quot; or &quot;9th&quot;.
</DD>

<DT>DAYOFWEEK</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the day of the week on which the message was sent,
according to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
For example, &quot;Sunday&quot; or &quot;Wednesday&quot;.
</DD>

<DT>DAYOFWEEKABBREV</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the day of the week on which the message was sent,
according to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
For example, &quot;Sun&quot; or &quot;Wed&quot;.
</DD>

<DT>MONTHABBREV</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the month the message was sent, according
to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
For example, &quot;Oct&quot;.
</DD>

<DT>MONTHLONG</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the month in which the message was sent, according
to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
For example, &quot;October&quot;.
</DD>

<DT>MONTH</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the month in which the message was sent, according
to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
For example, &quot;10&quot; or &quot;9&quot;.
</DD>

<DT>MONTH2DIGIT</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the month in which the message was sent, according
to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
For example, &quot;10&quot; or &quot;09&quot;.
It is always 2 digits.
</DD>

<DT>YEAR</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the year the message was sent, according
to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
For example, &quot;1998&quot; or &quot;2001&quot;.
</DD>

<DT>YEAR2DIGIT</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the year the message was sent, according
to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
For example, &quot;98&quot; or &quot;01&quot;.
It is always 2 digits.
</DD>

<DT>TIME24</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the time at which the message was sent, according
to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
There is no adjustment made for different time zones, so you'll get
the time the message was sent according to the time zone the sender
was in.
It has the format HH:MM. For example, &quot;17:28&quot;.
</DD>

<DT>TIME12</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the time at which the message was sent, according
to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
This time is for a 12 hour clock.
It has the format HH:MMpm.
For example, &quot;5:28pm&quot; or &quot;11:13am&quot;.
</DD>

<DT>TIMEZONE</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the numeric timezone from
the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
It has the format [+-]HHMM. For example, &quot;-0800&quot;.
</DD>

</DL>

<P>
<H1><EM>Tokens Available Only for <!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--></EM></H1>

<DL>
<DT>MSGNO</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the message's current position in the folder that,
of course, may change as the folder is sorted or new mail arrives.
</DD>

<DT>STATUS</DT>
<DD>
This token represents a three character wide field displaying various
aspects of the message's state.
The first character is either blank,
a '*' for message marked Important, or a '+' indicating a message
addressed directly to you (as opposed to your having received it via a
mailing list, for example).
When the feature
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_mark_for_cc"><!--#echo var="FEAT_mark-for-cc"--></A>&quot;
is set, if the first character would have been
blank then it will instead be a '-' if the message is cc'd to you.
The second character is typically blank,
though the arrow cursor may occupy it if either the 
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_force_low_speed"><!--#echo var="FEAT_assume-slow-link"--></A>&quot;
or the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_force_arrow"><!--#echo var="FEAT_force-arrow-cursor"--></A>&quot; feature
is set (or you actually are on a slow link).
The third character is either '<A HREF="h_flag_deleted">D</A>' (Deleted),
'<A HREF="h_flag_answered">A</A>' (Answered),
'<A HREF="h_flag_forwarded">F</A>' (Forwarded),
'<A HREF="h_flag_new">N</A>' (New), or blank.
<P>
If you are using a threaded view of the index and this message is at the
top of a collapsed portion of a thread,
then this token refers to all of the messages in the collapsed portion of
the thread instead of just the top message.
The first character will be a '*' if <EM>any</EM> of the messages in the thread
are marked Important, else a '+' if any of the messages are addressed
to you, else a '-' if any of the messages are cc'd to you.
The third character will be a 'D' if <EM>all</EM> of the messages
in the collapsed thread are marked deleted,
an 'A' if <EM>all</EM> of the messages
in the collapsed thread are marked answered,
it will be an 'N' if any of
the messages are undeleted and unseen, and it will be blank otherwise.
</DD>

<DT>FULLSTATUS</DT>
<DD>
This token represents a less abbreviated alternative
to the &quot;STATUS&quot; token.
It is six characters wide.
The first character is '+', '-', or blank, the
second blank, the third either '*' or blank, the fourth
'<A HREF="h_flag_new">N</A>' or blank,
the fifth '<A HREF="h_flag_answered">A</A>'
or blank, and the sixth character is
either '<A HREF="h_flag_deleted">D</A>' or
blank.
<P>
If you are using a threaded view of the index and this message is at the
top of a collapsed portion of a thread,
then this token refers to all of the messages in the collapsed portion of
the thread instead of just the top message.
The first character is '+', '-', or blank depending on whether <EM>any</EM>
of the messages in the collapsed thread are addressed to you or cc'd to you.
The third character will be '*' if any of the messages are marked
Important.
The fourth character will be 'N' if all of the messages in the thread
are New, else 'n' if some of the messages in the thread are New, else blank.
The fifth character will be 'A' or 'a' or blank, and the sixth character
will be 'D' or 'd' or blank.
</DD>

<DT>IMAPSTATUS</DT>
<DD>
This token represents an even less abbreviated alternative to the
&quot;STATUS&quot; token.
It differs from &quot;FULLSTATUS&quot; in only the fourth character, which is
an 'N' if the message is new to this folder since the last time
it was opened <EM>and</EM> it has not been viewed, an 'R' (Recent) if the message
is new to the folder and has been viewed, a 'U' (Unseen) if the message is not 
new to the folder since it was last opened <EM>but</EM> has not been
viewed, or a blank if the message has been in the folder since it was
last opened and has been viewed.
<P>
If you are using a threaded view of the index and this message is at the
top of a collapsed portion of a thread,
then the fourth character will be
'N' if all of the messages in the thread are unseen and recent;
else 'n' if some of the messages in the thread are unseen and recent;
else 'U' if all of the messages in the thread are unseen and not recent;
else 'u' if some of the messages in the thread are unseen and not recent;
else 'R' if all of the messages in the thread are seen and recent;
else 'r' if some of the messages in the thread are seen and recent;
else blank.
</DD>

<DT>SHORTIMAPSTATUS</DT>
<DD>
This is the same as the last four of the six characters of IMAPSTATUS,
so the '+' To Me information will be missing.
</DD>

<DT>SIZE</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size, in bytes, of the message.
If a &quot;K&quot; (Kilobyte)
follows the number, the size is approximately 1,000
times that many bytes (rounded to the nearest 1,000).
If an &quot;M&quot; (Megabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000 times that many bytes.
Commas are not used in this field.
This field is seven characters wide, including the enclosing parentheses.
Sizes are rounded when &quot;K&quot; or &quot;M&quot; is present.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0 1 ... 9999 10K ... 999K 1.0M ... 99.9M 100M ... 2000M</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>SIZECOMMA</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size, in bytes, of the message.
If a &quot;K&quot; (Kilobyte)
follows the number, the size is approximately 1,000
times that many bytes (rounded to the nearest 1,000).
If an &quot;M&quot; (Megabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000 times that many bytes.
Commas are used if the number shown is 1,000 or greater.
The SIZECOMMA field is one character wider than the SIZE field.
Sizes are rounded when &quot;K&quot; or &quot;M&quot; is present.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0 1 ... 99,999 100K ... 9,999K 10.0M ... 999.9M 1,000M ... 2,000M</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>KSIZE</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size of the message, expressed in
kilobytes or megabytes, as most appropriate.
These are 1,024 byte kilobytes and 1,024 x 1,024 byte megabytes.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0K 1K ... 1023K 1.0M ... 99.9M 100M ... 2047M</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>SIZENARROW</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size, in bytes, of the message.
If a &quot;K&quot; (Kilobyte)
follows the number, the size is approximately 1,000
times that many bytes.
If an &quot;M&quot; (Megabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000 times that many bytes.
If a &quot;G&quot; (Gigabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000,000 times that many bytes.
This field uses only five characters of screen width, including the enclosing
parentheses.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0 1 ... 999 1K ... 99K .1M ... .9M 1M ... 99M .1G ... .9G 1G 2G</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>DESCRIPSIZE</DT>
<DD>
This token is intended to represent a more useful description of the
message than just its size, but it isn't very useful at this point.
The plus sign in this view means there are attachments.
Note that including this token in
the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"-->&quot; could slow down the
display a little while Alpine collects the necessary information.
</DD>

<DT>SHORTSUBJECT</DT> 
<DD> This token is the same as SUBJECT, but removes 
text between &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;. Typically text enclosed 
between these characters corresponds to mailing list names, and may be 
unnecessary or unwanted in some instances. 
</DD>

<DT>SUBJKEY</DT>
<DD>
This token is the same as the SUBJECT token unless keywords are set for
the message.
In that case, a list of keywords enclosed in braces will be prepended to
the subject of the message.
Only those keywords that you have defined in your
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A> option
in Setup/Config are considered in the list.
In other words, keywords that have been set by some other means, perhaps
by another email program, won't show up unless included in
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A>.
Having this set in the <!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--> will also cause the keywords to be
prepended to the subject in the MESSAGE TEXT screen.
If you have given a keyword a nickname
(<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A>), that nickname is displayed
instead of the actual keyword.
The <A HREF="h_config_kw_braces"><!--#echo var="VAR_keyword-surrounding-chars"--></A>
option may be used to modify this token slightly.
It is also possible to color keywords in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
</DD>

<DT>SHORTSUBJKEY</DT>
<DD> This token is the same as SUBJKEY, but it is based on
SHORTSUBJECT, instead of in SUBJECT.
</DD>

<DT>SUBJKEYINIT</DT>
<DD>
This token is the same as the SUBJKEY token except that instead of
prepending a list of keywords to the subject, a list of first initials
of keywords will be prepended instead.
For example, if a message has the keywords <EM>Work</EM> and <EM>Now</EM>
set (or Work and Now are the Alpine nicknames of keywords that are set)
then the SUBJKEY token would cause a result like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{Work Now} actual subject</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
whereas the SUBJKEYINIT token would give
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{WN} actual subject</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Only those keywords that you have defined in your
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A> option
in Setup/Config are considered in the list.
In other words, keywords that have been set by some other means, perhaps
by another email program, won't show up unless included in
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A>.
The <A HREF="h_config_kw_braces"><!--#echo var="VAR_keyword-surrounding-chars"--></A>
option may be used to modify this token slightly.
It is also possible to color keywords in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
</DD>

<DT>SHORTSUBJKEYINIT</DT>
<DD> This token is the same as SUBJKEYINIT, but it is based on
SHORTSUBJECT, instead of in SUBJECT.
</DD>

<DT>SUBJECTTEXT</DT>
<DD>
Same as SUBJECT but if there is room in the Subject field for more text,
the opening part of the text of the message is displayed after the subject.
The time needed to fetch the text may cause a performance problem
which can, of course, be avoided by using the SUBJECT version of
the Subject instead.
You may color this opening text differently by using the
<A HREF="h_config_index_opening_color">Index Opening Color</A> option available from
the <A HREF="h_color_setup">Setup Kolor</A> screen.
You may adjust the characters that are displayed between the Subject and the
opening text with the option
<A HREF="h_config_opening_sep"><!--#echo var="VAR_opening-text-separator-chars"--></A>.
</DD>

<DT>SUBJKEYTEXT</DT>
<DD>
Same as SUBJKEY but with the opening message text.
</DD>

<DT>OPENINGTEXT</DT>
<DD>
This is similar to SUBJECTTEXT.
Instead of combining the Subject and the opening text in a single
field in the index screen this token allows you to allocate a
separate column just for the opening text of the message.
The time needed to fetch this text may cause a performance problem.
You may color this opening text differently by using the
<A HREF="h_config_index_opening_color">Index Opening Color</A> option available from
the <A HREF="h_color_setup">Setup Kolor</A> screen.
</DD>

<DT>OPENINGTEXTNQ</DT>
<DD>
This is very similar to OPENINGTEXT.
The NQ stands for No Quotes.
The only difference is that quoted text (lines beginning with &gt;) is deleted.
For some messages this may be confusing.
For example, a message might have a line preceding some quoted
text that reads something like &quot;On May 8th person A said.&quot;
That no longer makes sense after the quoted text is deleted and it
will appear that person A said whatever the text after the quote
is, even though that is really person B talking.
</DD>

<DT>SUBJKEYINITTEXT</DT>
<DD>
Same as SUBJKEYINIT but with the opening message text.
</DD>

<DT>KEY</DT>
<DD>
This is a space-delimited list of keywords that are set for the message.
Only those keywords that you have defined in your
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A> option
in Setup/Config are considered in the list.
In other words, keywords that have been set by some other means, perhaps
by another email program, won't show up unless included in
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A>.
If you have given a keyword a nickname
(<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A>), that nickname is displayed
instead of the actual keyword.
It is also possible to color keywords in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
This token defaults to an arbitrary width of 5.
You should set it to whatever width suits you using something
like KEY(17) in the <!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"-->.
</DD>

<DT>KEYINIT</DT>
<DD>
This is a list of keyword initials that are set for the message.
If you have given a keyword a nickname
(<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A>), the initial of that nickname
is displayed instead of the initial of the actual keyword.
It is also possible to color keyword initials in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
This token defaults to an arbitrary width of 2.
You should set it to whatever width suits you using something
like KEYINIT(3) in the <!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"-->.
</DD>

<DT>PRIORITY</DT>
<DD>
The X-Priority header is a non-standard header that is used in a
somewhat standard way by many mail programs.
Alpine expects the value of this header to be a digit with a value
from 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest priority and 5 the lowest priority.
Since this priority is something that the sender sets it is only an indication
of the priority that the sender attaches to the mail and it is therefore almost
totally unreliable for use as a filtering criterion.
This token will display the numeric value of the priority if it is between
1 and 5.
It will be suppressed (blank) if the value is 3, which is normal priority.
This token may be colored with the
<A HREF="h_config_index_pri_color">Index Priority Symbol Colors</A>.
</DD>

<DT>PRIORITYALPHA</DT>
<DD>
This is a more verbose interpretation of the X-Priority field.
Once again nothing is displayed unless the value of the field
is 1, 2, 4, or 5.
The values displayed for those values are:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR> <TD>1</TD> <TD>Highest</TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD>2</TD> <TD>High</TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD>4</TD> <TD>Low</TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD>5</TD> <TD>Lowest</TD> </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
This token may be colored with the
<A HREF="h_config_index_pri_color">Index Priority Symbol Colors</A>.
</DD>

<DT>PRIORITY!</DT>
<DD>
This is a one character, non-numeric version of the X-Priority field.
If the value of the X-Priority header is 1 or 2 an exclamation
point is displayed.
If the value is 4 or 5 a &quot;v&quot; (think down arrow) is displayed.
This token may be colored with the
<A HREF="h_config_index_pri_color">Index Priority Symbol Colors</A>.
</DD>

<DT>ATT</DT>
<DD>
This is a one column wide field that represents the number of attachments
a message has. It will be blank if there are no attachments, a single
digit for one to nine attachments, or an asterisk for more than nine.
Note that including this token in
the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"-->&quot; could slow down the
display a little while Alpine collects the necessary information.
</DD>

<DT>FROMORTO</DT>
<DD>
This token represents <EM>either</EM> the personal name (or email address) of
the person listed in the message's &quot;From:&quot; header
field, <EM>or</EM>, if that address is yours or one of your
<A HREF="h_config_alt_addresses">alternate addresses</A>,
the first person specified in the
message's &quot;To:&quot; header field
with the prefix &quot;To: &quot; prepended.
If the from address is yours and there is also no &quot;To&quot; address,
Alpine will use the address on the &quot;Cc&quot; line.
If there is no address there, either, Alpine will look for a newsgroup name
from the &quot;Newsgroups&quot; header field and put
that after the &quot;To: &quot; prefix.
</DD>

<DT>FROMORTONOTNEWS</DT>
<DD>
This is almost the same as <EM>FROMORTO</EM>.
The difference is that newsgroups aren't considered.
When a message is from you, doesn't have a To or Cc, and does have
a Newsgroups header; this token will be your name instead of the name
of the newsgroup (like it would be with FROMORTO).
</DD>

<DT>TEXT</DT>
<DD>
This is a different sort of token.
It allows you to display a label within each index line.
It will be the same fixed text for each line.
It is different from all the other tokens in that there is no space column
displayed after this token.
Instead, it is butted up against the following field.
It also has a different syntax.
The text to display is given following a colon after the
word &quot;TEXT&quot;.
For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>TEXT:abc=</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would insert the literal text &quot;abc=&quot; (without the quotes)
into the index display line.
You must quote the text if it includes space characters, like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>TEXT:&quot;abc&nbsp;=&nbsp;&quot;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>HEADER</DT>
<DD>
This allows you to display the text from a particular header line in the
message.
The syntax for this token is substantially different from all the others
in order that you might be able to display a portion of the text following
a particular header.
The header name you are interested in is given following a colon
after the word &quot;HEADER&quot;.
For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>HEADER:X-Spam</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would display the text of the X-Spam header, if any.
Like for other index tokens a width field may (and probably should)
follow this.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>HEADER:X-Spam(10)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
displays the first ten characters of the X-Spam header.
Unlike other index tokens, the syntax for HEADER is more flexible.
An optional second argument comes after a comma inside the parentheses.
It specifies the &quot;field&quot; number.
By default, the field separator is a space character.
No extra space characters are allowed in the argument list.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>HEADER:X-Spam(10,2)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would display the second field, left-justified, in a 10 character
wide field.
The second field would consist of all the text after the first space
up to the next space or the end of the header.
The default field number is zero, which stands for the entire line.
There is also an optional third argument that is a list of field
separators. It defaults to a space character.
The example
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>HEADER:X-Spam(10,2,:%&nbsp;)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would cause the field separators to be any of colon, percent,
or space (there is a space character between the percent and the
right parenthesis).
The first field runs from the start of the header value up to the first
colon, percent, or space; the second goes from there to the next; and so on.
In order to use a comma character as a field separator you must escape
it by preceding it with a backslash (&#92;).
The same is true of the backslash character itself.
There is one further optional argument.
It is an R or an L to specify right or left adjustment of the text
within the field.
The default is to left justify, however if you are displaying numbers
you might prefer to right justify.
<P>
Here's an example of a SpamAssassin header.
The exact look of the header will vary, but if your incoming mail
contains headers that look like the following
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>X-Spam-Status: Yes, hits=10.6 tagged_above=-999.0 required=7.0 tests=BAYE...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
you might want to display the hits value.
The first field starts with the Y in Yes.
To get what you're interested in you might use &quot;=&quot; and
space as the field separators and display the third field, like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>HEADER:X-Spam-Status(4,3,=&nbsp;)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or maybe you would break at the dot instead
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>HEADER:X-Spam-Status(2,2,=.,R)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Another example we've seen has headers that look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>X-Spam: Gauge=IIIIIII, Probability=7%, Report=...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Because there are two equals and a comma before the 7% and a comma
after it, the token
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>HEADER:X-Spam(3,4,=&#92;,,R)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
should display the probability (for example 7% or 83%) right justified
in a 3-wide field.
</DD>

<DT>ARROW</DT>
<DD>
This gives an alternative way to display the current message in the
MESSAGE INDEX screen.
Usually the current message is indicated by the line being shown in
reverse video.
Instead, if the ARROW token is included in your <!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"-->,
the current line will include an &quot;arrow&quot; that
looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>-&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
in the ARROW token's field.
For all of the non-current messages, the ARROW field will be filled
with blanks.
If you use the fixed-field width feature the length of the &quot;arrow&quot;
may be adjusted.
The arrow will be drawn as width-1 dashes followed by a greater than sign.
For example, if you use ARROW(3) you will get
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>--&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and ARROW(1) will give you just
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
It is also possible to set the color of the ARROW field.
By default (and for non-current messages) the arrow is colored the same
as the index line it is part of.
You may set it to be another color with the 
<A HREF="h_config_index_arrow_color">Index Arrow Color</A> option available from
the <A HREF="h_color_setup">Setup Kolor</A> screen.
</DD>

<DT>SCORE</DT>
<DD>
This gives the
<a href="h_rules_score">score</a>
of each message.
This will be six columns wide to accomodate the widest possible score.
You will probably want to use the <!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--> fixed-field width feature
to limit the width of the field to the widest score that
you use (e.g. SCORE(3) if your scores are always between 0 and 999).
If you have not defined any score rules the scores will all be zero.
If any of your score rules contain AllText or BodyText patterns
then including SCORE in the <!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"-->
may slow down the display of the MESSAGE INDEX screen.

This token is different from the others.
When it is replaced it is replaced with nothing, but it sets an Alpine
internal variable that tells the composer to start with the cursor
positioned at the position where this token was.
If both the template file and the signature file contain
a &quot;CURSORPOS&quot; token, then the position in the template file
is used.
If there is a template file and neither it nor the signature file contains
a &quot;CURSORPOS&quot; token, then the cursor is positioned
after the end of the contents of the
template file when the composer starts up.

<H1>Conditional Inclusion of Text for <!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"-->, Signatures, and Templates</H1>

Conditional text inclusion may be used with
the <A HREF="h_config_reply_intro">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"-->&quot;</A> option,
in signature files, and in template files used in
<A HREF="h_rules_roles">&quot;roles&quot;</A>.
It may <EM>not</EM> be used with the
<A HREF="h_config_index_format">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"-->&quot;</A> option.

<P>
There is a limited if-else capability for including text.
The if-else condition is based
on whether or not a given token would result in replacement text you
specify.
The syntax of this conditional inclusion is
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_token_(match_this, if_matched [ , if_not_matched ] )</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The left parenthesis must follow the underscore immediately, with no
intervening space.
It means the token is expanded and the results of that expansion are
compared against the &quot;match_this&quot; argument.
If there is an exact match, then the &quot;if_matched&quot; text is used
as the replacement text.
Otherwise, the &quot;if_not_matched&quot; text is used.
One of the most useful values for the &quot;match_this&quot; argument is
the empty string, &quot;&quot;.
In that case the expansion is compared against the empty string.
<P>
Here's an example to make it clearer.
This text could be included in one of your template files:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_NEWS_(&quot;&quot;, &quot;I'm replying to email&quot;, &quot;I'm replying to news&quot;)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If that is included in a template file that you are using while replying
to a message (because you chose to use the role it was part of),
and that message has a newsgroup header and a newsgroup in that header,
then the text
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>I'm replying to news</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
will be included in the message you are about to compose.
On the other hand, if the message you are replying to does not have
a newsgroup, then the text
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>I'm replying to email</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would be included instead.
This would also work in signature files and in
the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"-->&quot; option.
If the &quot;match_this&quot;, &quot;if_matched&quot;,
or &quot;if_not_matched&quot; arguments contain
spaces, parentheses, or commas;
they have to be quoted with double quotation marks (like in the example
above).
If you want to include a literal quote (&quot;) in the text you must escape the
quote by preceding it with a backslash (&#92;) character.
If you want to include a literal backslash character you must escape it
by preceding it with another backslash.
<P>
The comma followed by &quot;if_not_matched&quot; is optional.
If there is no &quot;if_not_matched&quot;
present then no text is included if the not_matched case is true.
Here's another example:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_NEWS_(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;This msg was seen in group: _NEWS_.&quot;)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Here you can see that tokens may appear in the arguments.
The same is true for tokens with the conditional parentheses.
They may appear in arguments,
though you do have to be careful to get the quoting and escaping of
nested double quotes correct.
If this was in the signature file being used and you were replying to a message
sent to comp.mail.pine the resulting text would be:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>This msg was seen in group: comp.mail.pine.</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If you were replying to a message that wasn't sent to any newsgroup the
resulting text would be a single blank line.
The reason you'd get a blank line is because the end of the line is
outside of the conditional, so is always included.
If you wanted to get rid of that blank line you could do so by moving
the end of line inside the conditional.
In other words, it's ok to have multi-line
&quot;if_matched&quot; or &quot;if_not_matched&quot; arguments in your
template file.
The text just continues until the next double quotation, even if it's not
on the same line.
<P>
Here's an example for use in the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"-->&quot;:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On _DAYDATE_, _FROM__CURNEWS_(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;seen in _CURNEWS_,&quot;) wrote</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If this was in your <!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"--> and you were replying to a message
while reading the newsgroup comp.mail.pine the resulting text would be:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On Sat, 24 Oct 1998, Fred Flintstone, seen in comp.mail.pine, wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If you were replying to a message while reading an email folder instead
of a newsgroup the resulting leadin text would be
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On Sat, 24 Oct 1998, Fred Flintstone wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Here's one more (contrived) example illustrating a matching argument
that is not the empty string.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_SMARTDATE_("Today", _SMARTDATE_, "On _DATE_") _FROM_ wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If this was the value of your &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"-->&quot; option and you
were replying to
a message that was sent today, then the value of the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"-->&quot;
would be
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Today Fred Flintstone wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
But if you were replying to a message sent on Oct. 27 (and that wasn't
today) you would get

<BODY>
<H1>Server Name Syntax</H1>

This help describes the syntax that may be used for server names
that may be associated with remote folders or SMTP servers.

<P>
A server name is the hostname of the server.
It's a good idea to use the host's fully-qualified network name.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>foo.example.com</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

However, IP addresses are allowed if surrounded
with square-brackets.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[127.0.0.1]</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

An optional network port number may be supplied by appending
a colon (:) followed by the port number
to the server name.
By default, the IMAP port number, 143, is used.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>foo.example.com:port</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Besides server name and optional port number, various other optional
parameters may be supplied that alter Alpine's interaction with the server.
A parameter is supplied by appending a slash (/) character followed by
the parameter's name and,
depending on the particular parameter, the value assigned to that
name, to the server name (and optional port number).
Parameter names are <EM>not</EM> case sensitive.
Currently supported parameters include:

<DL>

<DT>User</DT>
<DD>This parameter requires an associated value, and is intended to
provide the username identifier with which to establish the server
connection.
If your SMTP server offers SMTP AUTH authentication, adding this 
parameter to the
<A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_smtp-server"-->&quot;</A>
option will cause Alpine to attempt to authenticate to the server using the
supplied username.
Similarly, if your NNTP server offers NNTP &quot;AUTHINFO SASL&quot;
or &quot;AUTHINFO USER&quot; authentication, adding this parameter to the
<A HREF="h_config_nntp_server"><!--#echo var="VAR_nntp-server"--></A>
option (or to the server name for any folder collection using NNTP)
will cause Alpine to attempt
to authenticate to the server using the supplied username.
An example might be:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/user=katie</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>TLS</DT>
<DD>
Normally, when a new connection is made an attempt is made to 
negotiate a secure (encrypted) session using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
If that fails then a non-encrypted connection will be attempted instead.
This is a unary parameter indicating communication with the server must 
take place over a TLS connection. If the attempt to use TLS fails then
this parameter will cause the connection to fail instead of falling
back to an unsecure connection. <A href="h_security_considerations">Learn more</A>
about security considerations when you use this option.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/tls</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>SSL</DT>
<DD>
This is a unary parameter indicating communication with the server should 
take place over a Secure Socket Layer connection.  The server must support
this method, and be prepared to accept connections on the appropriate
port (993 by default).
Alpine must be linked with an SSL library for this option to be operational.
Using this option will make Alpine try to connect to the server using the
most secure encrypted SSL connection that both your version of Alpine and the
server support.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/ssl</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>TLS1</DT>
<DD>
This parameter indicates that the connection to the server will be made
over the SSL port, but using the TLSv1 protocol, instead of the usual
SSLv3 or SSLv2 protocols.
Alpine must be linked with an SSL library for this option to be operational.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/tls1</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>TLS1_1</DT>
<DD>
This parameter indicates that the connection to the server will be made
over the SSL port, but using the TLSv1.1 protocol.
Alpine must be linked with an SSL library that supports this encryption
protocol for this option to be operational.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/tls1_1</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>TLS1_2</DT>
<DD>
This parameter indicates that the connection to the server will be made
over the SSL port, but using the TLSv1.2 protocol.
Alpine must be linked with an SSL library that supports this encryption
protocol for this option to be operational.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/tls1_2</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>TLS1_3</DT>
<DD>
This parameter indicates that the connection to the server will be made
over the SSL port, but using the TLSv1.3 protocol.
Alpine must be linked with an SSL library that supports this encryption
protocol for this option to be operational.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/tls1_3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>NoValidate-Cert</DT>
<DD>Do not validate certificates (for TLS or SSL connections) from the server.
This is needed if the server uses self-signed certificates or if Alpine
cannot validate the certificate for some other known reason. You should avoid
using this option, and instead install the certificate of the server, so you
are not a victim of a cracker-in-the-middle attack.
<P>
</DD>

<DT>Anonymous</DT>
<DD>This is a unary parameter (that means it does not have a value)
indicating that the connection be logged in as
&quot;anonymous&quot; rather than a specific user.
Not all servers offer anonymous
access; those which do generally only offer read-only access to certain
&quot;public&quot; folders.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/anonymous</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>Secure</DT>
<DD>This is a unary parameter indicating that the connection use the
most secure authentication method mutually supported by Alpine and the
server.
Alpine is capable of authenticating connections to 
the server using several methods.
By default, Alpine will attempt each
method until either a connection is established or the
list of methods is exhausted.
This parameter causes Alpine to instead fail 
the connection if the first (generally most &quot;secure&quot;) method fails.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/secure</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>Submit</DT>
<DD>This is a unary parameter for use with the
<A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_smtp-server"-->&quot;</A> option.
It indicates that the connection should be made to the Submit server
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2476.txt">RFC 3676</A>)
(port 587) instead of the SMTP port (25).
At the time this help was written the submit option was equivalent to
specifying port 587. <A href="h_security_considerations">Learn more</A>
about security considerations when you use this option.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/submit</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>host:587</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>Debug</DT>
<DD>This is a unary parameter indicating that the connection be established
in a verbose mode.  Basically, it causes Alpine to log the communication with
the server in Alpine's debug file.
Normally, the pine -d command-line flag would be used instead.
<P>
</DD>

<DT>NoRsh</DT>
<DD>By default, Alpine attempts to login using &quot;rsh&quot;,
the UNIX remote shell program.
Including &quot;NoRsh&quot; will cause connections to this server to skip
the &quot;rsh&quot; attempt.
This might be useful to avoid long timeouts caused by rsh firewalls, for
example.
<P>
</DD>

<DT>Loser</DT>
<DD>This option makes sense only for IMAP servers that do not perform
a SEARCH command correctly. If your filtering rules
fail to filter some messages, that should have been filtered, then this
option will make Alpine download all data necessary data to perform that 
search. There is a performance penalty when using this option. Downloading 
the data to perfom the search will take longer than requesting the IMAP
server to perform the filtering, but the filtering will be done correctly.
<P>
</DD>


<DT>Service</DT>
<DD>This parameter requires an associated value.  The default value is
&quot;IMAP&quot; which indicates communication with the server based
on the IMAP4rev1 protocol (defined in RFC 3501 -- see 
<A HREF="http://www.imap.org/docs/rfc3501.html">http://www.imap.org/docs/rfc3501.html</A>).</DD>

Other service values include:
 <DL>
 <DT>NNTP</DT>
 <DD>This value indicates communication with the server takes place via
the Network News Transfer Protocol.  Use this to define a collection
of newsgroups on a remote news server.  So

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/service=NNTP</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or just
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/NNTP</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

is the way to specify NNTP access.
<P>
 </DD>

 <DT>POP3</DT>
 <DD>This value indicates communication with the server takes place via the
Post Office Protocol 3 protocol.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/service=POP3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or just
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/POP3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Note that there are several important issues
to consider when selecting this option:
<OL>
 <LI> POP3 provides access to only your INBOX.  In other words,
secondary folders such as your &quot;saved-messages&quot; are inaccessible.
 <LI> Alpine's implementation of POP3 does not follow the traditional POP
model and will leave your mail on the server. Refer to the
<A HREF="h_maildrop">Mail Drop</A> functionality for a possible way around this problem.
 <LI> See the discussion about new-mail checking in <A HREF="h_config_reopen_rule">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_folder-reopen-rule"-->&quot;</A>.
</OL>
</DD>
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
Note that it is possible to include more than one parameter in a server
specification by concatenating the parameters. For example:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>foo.example.com:port/user=katie/novalidate-cert/debug</SAMP></CENTER>

<TITLE>SSL, TLS, STARTTLS and More Security Considerations</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>SSL, TLS, STARTTLS and More Security Considerations</H1>

The purpose of this text is to educate users on how to best choose
the type of security connection to a remote server using the SSL and TLS
encryption protocols.

<P>
In the past, and when Alpine originally started to support encrypted connections
to remote servers, the /ssl modifier was needed, and it meant any of the SSLv2
or SSLv3 protocols. Those encryption protocols are considered not fully secure
anymore, and in fact, you might not be able to use them anymore.

<P> Today the /ssl modifier means to use the most secure encryption 
protocol between your version of Alpine and what the server supports. This 
might mean more modern protocols, such as TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, etc. As of 
this writing, Alpine supports connection using TLS 1.3. These protocols
are considered more secure today and they should be preferred over the old
SSL protocols.

<P> A source of confusion for Alpine users might be the meaning of the 
modifier /tls with respect to the names of the encryption protocols, such 
as TLS 1.2. The meaning of /tls is to start an encrypted connection to a 
server after an insecure connection has been established, and we will 
discuss this later in this help text. 

<P>The best way to start an encrypted connection to a server is to use the 
/ssl modifier. If your provider allows encrypted connections on port 993 
for IMAP, or port 995 for POP3, or in port 465 for SMTP, just define your 
server by adding the /ssl modifier and do not add the port to the server. 
Alpine knows that the secure connection will be done in the correct port, 
and will use the most secure encryption available between Alpine and the 
server. You only need to use the port number when it is different from the
default port numbers for this type of connections, and those were given
above.

<P>Most email service providers identify secure connections by saying 
&quot;SSL or TLS&quot;. In this case, use the /ssl modifier, and only use 
the port number in case it is different to the ones above.

<P>If your service provider says to use STARTTLS, then you need to use the 
/tls modifier. If your service provider gives you the option to use SSL or 
TLS and to use STARTTLS choose the secure port and choose the /ssl 
modifier. This is because connections using the /tls modifier can be 
attacked and your username and password can be stolen by a hacker. The next
paragraph describes in short how to do this.

<P> When you use the /tls modifier, Alpine connects insecurely to the 
remote server. Because the connection is insecure, it is possible that you 
connect to a different server, which connects you to the real server. This 
is called &quot;man-in-the-middle&quot; attack, and so your communication 
will pass through the hackers computer before it reaches the real target. 
An example of a possible man-in-the-middle is your internet service provider, 
or your employer in some instances.
This means that the hacker can modify the replies from the correct server 
and give you the illusion of security before you are actually connected to 
the secure server. Therefore, you might disclose your username and 
password to the hacker before you establish a secure connection to the correct
server.

<P> Therefore, if possible avoid using STARTTLS (for IMAP and POP) or SUBMIT
for SMTP (in port 587), as these are subject to attack. If possible
ask your provider for secure connections for SSL or TLS in the secure ports

<P> In the current state, even as of TLS 1.3, these protocols are considered

Encryption protocols are evolving to not only protect the security of your

<H1>Collection Edit Help -- Server Field</H1>

This collection's &quot;Server:&quot; definition indicates the
hostname of the server providing access to the folders in this
collection.
The syntax of this server name is the same as for other server names used
in remote folder names in
Alpine and is described
<A HREF="h_folder_server_syntax">here</A>.

<TITLE>Collection Path: Explained</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Collection Edit Help -- Path Field</H1>

The collection's &quot;Path:&quot; definition indicates the location
of the folders in this collection.  If the path or any of its components
do not exist, Alpine will prompt you for their creation when exiting the
Add/Change screen.

<P> 
By default the path is interpreted as defining a section of your personal
folder area.  This area and how you specify it are defined by the
server, if one is specified in the collection, or, typically, the home
directory if no server is defined.

<P>
To define a collection outside the default &quot;area&quot;, prefix
the path with the &quot;namespace&quot; to use when interpreting the
given path.  If a namespace is specified, the Path begins with the
sharp, &quot;#&quot;, character followed by the name of the namespace
and then the namespace's path-element-delimiter.  Aside from the
path's format, namespaces can also imply access rights, content
policy, audience, location, and, occasionally, access methods.

<P>
Each server exports its own set (possibly of size one) of 
namespaces.  Hence, it's likely communication with your server's
administrator will be required for specific configurations.  Some of
the more common namespaces, however, include:

<DL>
<DT>#news.</DT>
<DD>This specifies a set of folders in the newsgroup namespace.  Newsgroup
names are hierarchically defined with each level delimited by a period.
</DD>
<DT>#public/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that the server may export to the general
public.
</DD>
<DT>#shared/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that the folder may export to groups
of users.
</DD>
<DT>#ftp/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that is the same as that it may have 
exported via the &quot;File Transfer Protocol&quot;.
</DD>
<DT>#mh/</DT>
<DD>This specifies the personal folder area associated with folders
and directories that were created using the MH message handling system.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>

In addition, the server may support access to other user's folders,
provided you have suitable permissions.  Common methods use a prefix
of either &quot;~<VAR>user</VAR>/&quot;, or &quot;/<VAR>user</VAR>/&quot; to
indicate the root of the other user's folder area.

No, nothing's simple.

<H1>Collection Edit Help -- View Field</H1>

The collection's &quot;View:&quot; definition provides a way to limit
the displayed list of folders within a collection.  By default, only
folders that contain the specified characters anywhere in their name
are shown in the collection's folder list.

<P>
Additionally, you can use a wildcard character to better control
the list of folders selected for display.  The wildcard specifier is
the star, &quot;*&quot;, character.

<P>
So, for example, to define a collection of all folders ending with
&quot;c&quot;, you'd specify a view of &quot;*c&quot; (without the
quote characters!).  Or, similarly, to define a collection of folders
whose names start with &quot;a&quot; and end with &quot;z&quot;, you'd
specify a view of &quot;a*z&quot;.

this is the name of a file in which the address book will be stored.
The file is in the same directory as the Alpine configuration file if the

Fill in as many of these fields as you wish to narrow down your

to be returned. You may use the wildcard character &quot;*&quot; in
any of the fields, it matches any zero or more characters at that
point in the string. There are no implicit wildcards, so the match is
exact unless you include wildcards.
<P>

Note that if an attribute isn't present at all, then the match will fail.
For example, if a server doesn't support the Locality attribute, then no
matter what you put in the Locality field (other than leaving it empty)
the search will fail.

This one is for advanced users only! If you put something in this field,
then the rest of the fields are ignored.

This field may be set to the string representation of an LDAP search
filter (see RFC1960). Here are some examples:

To search for an entry with a surname equal to "clinton" you could set
the custom filter to:

     (sn=clinton)
    
This is equivalent to putting "clinton" in the SurName field.
To search for an entry that has a surname that begins with "clint" and
has a givenname equal to "william" you could use:

     (&(sn=clint*)(givenname=william))
    
This is equivalent to setting the SurName field to "clint*" and the
GivenName field to "william".
To search for an entry where either the common name OR the email address
contains "abcde" you could use:

     (|(cn=*abcde*)(mail=*abcde*))

That isn't equivalent to anything you can do by setting the other fields
because of the OR.

<H1>INTERNET EMAIL ADDRESS FORMAT</H1>

A valid email address on the Internet has a username, an &quot;@&quot; sign, 
and then a domain, with no spaces.  
For example, jsmith@art.example.com might be the email address
of a person  
with the username &quot;jsmith&quot; who has an account in the domain
&quot;art.example.com&quot;.  The number of dot-separated segments on the 
right of the &quot;@&quot; sign can vary - a shorter example would be 
isabelle@elsewhere.edu (the shortest possible form: here, only the 
organization's domain is specified after the &quot;@&quot; sign); a longer 
example would be 
 jsingh@shakti.edutech.example.com
(here, the name of the host &quot;shakti&quot; in the domain 
edutech.example.com is also specified).  
<P>  
If you do not know the exact email address of someone you want to write 
to, ask them what it is using other means of communication than email; or 
use the tools for 
finding people's addresses that are available on the Internet.
<P>
If you are sending to someone on the same system as you are, you can leave
the &quot;@&quot; sign and all the information to its right off of the 
address, and Alpine will fill it in automatically, 
unless the feature 
<A HREF="h_config_compose_rejects_unqual">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs"-->&quot;</A> is set in SETUP CONFIGURATION.
<P>

When an email address you send a message to is not reachable -- either because 
it is simply an incorrect address, or because email can temporarily not be 
delivered to it due to a technical problem on the way to or at the recipient's 
end -- you will almost always get an error notification email message back.
<P>
If you encounter problems with, or have questions about, email delivery or
email address syntax, contact your local network computing consultants.

<P>
In the good old days a mailcap viewer was used to examine an 
attachment before saving it, and after viewing the attachment control 
would return to the operating system when the viewer was closed. Therefore, 
when the mailcap viewer returned control to the operating system, it 
could be assumed that the user who opened the attachment was done
examining it, and the copy of the attachment that was used, could be removed.

<P>
However, today this assumption is not longer valid. Some viewers return 
control to the operating system before they actually read the attachment
to be examined. This causes Alpine to delete the attachment before it 
is read by the viewer, causing the viewer to fail opening the attachment.

<P>
In order to work around this problem, Alpine checks, after the viewer has 
returned control to the operating system, if there is any process that is 
using the attachment. This variable controls the number of seconds that 
must elapse between checks. Once it is found that no process is using the 
attachment, this is removed.

<P>
The minimum value for this variable is 60 (checks will be made once per 
minute), and the maximum value is 600 (checks will be made once every 10

<h1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_pruned-folders"--></h1>

This variable allows you to define a list of one or more folders that
Alpine will offer to prune for you in the same way it automatically offers
to prune your "sent-mail" folder each month.
Each folder in this list must be a folder in your default folder collection
(the first folder collection if you have more than one), and it is just
the relative name of the folder in the collection, not the fully-qualified name.
It is similar to sent-mail.
Instead of something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP><!--#echo var="VAR_pruned-folders"-->={servername}mail/folder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
the correct value to use would be

There is an assumption here that your first collection is the folders in

the contents of the folder to a new folder of the same name but with
the previous month's date appended.  Alpine will then look for any such
date-appended folder names created for a previous month, and offer each
one it finds for deletion.
<P>

If you decline the first offer, no mail is moved and no new folder is
created.
<P>

The new folders will be created
in your default folder collection.

This option affects the behavior of the Composer's &quot;Read File&quot; 
(^R in the message body) and &quot;Attach File&quot; (^J in the header) 
commands.  It specifies
a Unix program name, and any necessary command line arguments, that Alpine can
use to transfer files from your personal computer into messages that you are
composing.<P>

<B>Note:</B> this facility is intended for use with serial line transfer 
protocols, such as kermit, xmodem, or zmodem.  It is <B>not</B> intended
to work with TCP/IP file transfer programs such as ftp.<P>

If a program is specified, the commands listed above are modified to offer a
subcommand (^Y) to activate the transfer.  Obviously, the Unix program
specified here must match the transfer program or protocol available on the
personal computer.<P>

Alpine expects to exchange uploaded data via a file on your Unix system.  When
the specified upload program finishes, Alpine expects the uploaded data to be
contained in this file.<P>

When upload is invoked via the &quot;Read File&quot; subcommand, Alpine 
generates a
temporary file name that it will pass to the specified Unix program.  Alpine
will read the resulting uploaded text from this file and then delete it when
the upload command is finished.<P>

When upload is invoked via the &quot;Attach File&quot; subcommand, Alpine will 
prompt
you for the name of the file that is to contain the uploaded information that
it is to attach.  Alpine will attach this file to the composition, but will
<B>not</B> delete this file after the upload command is finished.<P>

The special token &quot;_FILE_&quot; may be included among the Unix program's 
command
line arguments.  Alpine will replace this symbol with the name of the file
being used to exchange the uploaded information.  This token allows you to
position the file name where it is required in the Unix program's command
line arguments.<P>

If the &quot;_FILE_&quot; token is not present in the specified command, the
temporary file's name is automatically appended to the specified Unix
program.  In other words, you don't need to use &quot;_FILE_&quot; if it is the

<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_smtp-server"--></H1>
This value specifies the name of one or more SMTP 
(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) servers for sending mail. 
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
You must have an SMTP server for use with PC-Alpine.
SMTP servers are
normally set up by a system administrator for use by all members of a given
campus or department.
Contact your local help desk to ask what SMTP
servers you should use.  
<!--chtml else-->
Unix Alpine users may not need to set an SMTP server.
Alpine will attempt to execute the program (usually sendmail) that is used
to insert mail into the mail system.
If this works for you, you may leave this option blank.
If there is an SMTP server running on the Unix host you may be able to
improve sending performance slightly by setting the SMTP server option
to &quot;localhost&quot; or to the actual name of the Unix host.
<P>
If the Unix host doesn't work the way Alpine was expecting you will need to
set the value of this option.
SMTP servers are
normally set up by a system administrator for use by all members of a given
campus or department.
Contact your local help desk to ask what SMTP
servers you should use.  
<!--chtml endif-->
<P>
Your SMTP server may offer SMTP AUTH authentication.
It may even require it.
If your SMTP server offers SMTP AUTH authentication you may specify a
&quot;user&quot; name parameter to cause Alpine to attempt to authenticate.
This parameter requires an associated value,
the username identifier with which to establish the server
connection.
An example might be:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>smtpserver.example.com/user=katie</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

If AUTH authentication is offered by the server, this will cause Alpine to
attempt to use it.
If AUTH authentication is not offered by the server, this will cause Alpine
to fail sending with an error similar to:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Error: SMTP authentication not available</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Another type of authentication that is used by some ISPs is called
&quot;POP before SMTP&quot; or &quot;IMAP before SMTP&quot;,
which means that you have to authenticate
yourself to the POP or IMAP server by opening a mailbox before you
can send mail.
To do this, you usually only have to open your INBOX.

<P>
You may tell Alpine to use the
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2476.txt">Message Submission</A>
port (587) instead of the SMTP port (25) by including the &quot;submit&quot;
parameter
in this option.
At this time &quot;/submit&quot; is simply equivalent to specifying
port 587, though it may imply more than that at some point in the future.
Some ISPs are blocking port 25 in order to reduce the amount of spam
being sent to their users.
You may find that the submit option allows you to get around such a block.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>smtpserver.example.com/submit</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

To specify any non-standard port number on the SMTP server you may follow
the hostname with a colon followed by the portnumber.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>smtpserver.example.com:12345</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Normally, when a connection is made to the Smtp-Server Alpine will attempt
to negotiate a secure (encrypted) session using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
If that fails then a non-encrypted connection will be attempted instead.
You may specify that a TLS connection is required if you wish.
If you append &quot;/tls&quot; to the name then the connection will fail
instead of falling back to a non-secure connection.

This value specifies the name of one or more NNTP
(Network News Transfer Protocol)
servers for reading and posting USENET news.
NNTP servers are normally
set up by a system administrator for use by all members of a given campus
or department.
Contact your local help desk to ask what NNTP servers you should use.  
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"--><!--chtml else-->
Often Unix Alpine users will find that this variable has been
set for the whole system (and they don't have to worry about it).  
<!--chtml endif-->
When you define an NNTP server here, Alpine implicitly defines a news
collection for you, assuming that server as the news server and assuming
that you will use the NNTP protocol and a local newsrc configuration file
for reading news.
For more about reading news with Alpine, see
<A HREF="h_reading_news">how to use Alpine to read news</A>.
<P>
Your NNTP server may offer NNTP &quot;AUTHINFO SASL&quot;
or &quot;AUTHINFO USER&quot; authentication.
It may even require it.
If your NNTP server does offer such authentication you may specify a user name
parameter to cause Alpine to attempt to authenticate.
The same is true for the server name in a folder collection that uses NNTP.
This parameter requires an associated value,
the username identifier with which to establish the server connection.
An example might be:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>nntpserver.example.com/user=katie</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

If authentication is offered by the server, this will cause Alpine to
attempt to use it.
If authentication is not offered by the server, this will cause Alpine

<H1>How to Change your From Address</H1>

If the From address that Alpine includes in mail that you send is not correct,
you may want to configure a different default value for the From address.
You may follow these directions to change the default:

<P>
<UL>
  <LI> Go to the Main Alpine Menu
  <LI> From there type the Setup Command
  <LI> From there type the Config Command
</UL>

<P>
You've probably already seen this SETUP CONFIGURATION screen.
If not, there are many options you may want to set here.
To set the value of the From header you may use the
<A href="h_config_custom_hdrs"><!--#echo var="VAR_customized-hdrs"--></A> option.
Find it by scrolling down a few pages or use the WhereIs command to
search for &quot;customized&quot;.
You may want to read the help text associated with the option.
<P>
To add a custom From header, type the Add command and enter the
full header line, including the leading &quot;From:&nbsp;&quot;.
For example:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>From: Full Name &lt;user@example.com&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Now exit the Setup command and try sending mail to yourself to see
what the From line looks like.
<P>
When you are in the composer you may edit the custom From line by typing
Ctrl-R while your cursor is in the headers of the message and then moving
to the From line and editing.
If you want to leave the default value the same but add the possibility
of being able to edit the header when you compose, add just the header
name without a value.
For example:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>From:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If you change your From address you may also find it useful to add the
changed From address to the
<a href="h_config_alt_addresses"><!--#echo var="VAR_alt-addresses"--></a>

Tip: If you are using different installations of (PC-)Alpine -- for example, PC-Alpine on your personal

By virtue of specifying a folder name here, Alpine will be configured to
save all messages that you have read during a session into the designated
&quot;read messages&quot; folder.  This allows you to more easily distinguish
between your really new email (in your INBOX) and those that you have
already read.  Depending on how you define the 
<A HREF="h_config_auto_read_msgs">&quot;auto-move-read-messages&quot;</A>
setting, you may or may not be asked when you quit
Alpine if you want read messages to be moved to this folder.  In either
case, moving the messages means they will be deleted from your INBOX.
<P>
If this is not a path name, it will be in the default collection for
saves.  Any valid folder specification, local or remote (via IMAP), is
allowed.  There is no default for the name of the read message folder.

<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_form-letter-folder"--></H1>

A &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_form-letter-folder"-->&quot; is a mail folder that is intended to
contain messages that you have composed and that are intended to be
sent in their original form repeatedly.

<P>
Setting this variable will alter Alpine's usual behavior when you
execute the Compose command.  Normally, Alpine offers a chance to
continue a postponed or interrupted message should one or the other
exist.  When this variable is set to a folder name that exists, Alpine
will also offer the chance to select a message from the folder to
insert into the composer (much like when continuing a postponed message).
The difference, however, is that Alpine will not automatically delete
the selected message from the Form Letter Folder.
<P>
Setting this variable will also affect Alpine's behavior when you
Postpone a message from the composer.  Normally, Alpine simply stashes
the message away in your
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_postponed_folder"><!--#echo var="VAR_postponed-folder"--></A>&quot;.
Regardless of the specified folder's existence, Alpine will ask which
folder you intend the message to be stored in.  Choose the
&quot;F&quot; option to store the message in your Form Letter Folder.
This is the most common way to add a message to the folder.

<P>
Another method of adding messages to the folder is via the Alpine
composer's <SAMP>Fcc:</SAMP> field.  If you are sending a message that
you expect to send in the same form again, you can enter the Form
Letter Folder's name in this field.  Alpine, as usual, will copy the
message as it's sent.  Note, when you later select this message from 
your Form Letter Folder, it will have the same recipients as the original
message.

<P>
To delete a message from the Form Letter Folder, you can either select
the folder from a suitable FOLDER LIST screen, or use the Delete
command in the MESSAGE INDEX offered when selecting from the folder as
part of the Compose command.  You can delete a Form Letter Folder just
as any other folder from a suitable FOLDER LIST screen.

<P>
You may find that the <A HREF="h_rules_roles">&quot;Roles&quot;</A>
facility can be used
to replace the Form Letter Folder.

This is like
<A HREF="h_config_read_message_folder"><!--#echo var="VAR_read-message-folder"--></A>,
only more general.  You may archive
any of the folders in your incoming collection.  This is a list of folder
pairs, with the first separated from the second in the pair by a space.
The first folder in a pair is the folder you want to archive, and the
second folder is the folder that read messages from the first should be
moved to.  Depending on how you define the
<A HREF="h_config_auto_read_msgs">&quot;auto-move-read-messages&quot;</A>
setting, you may or may not be asked when you
leave the first folder if you want read messages to be moved to the
second folder.  In either case, moving the messages means they will be
deleted from the first folder.
<P>
The name of the first folder in each pair can be either the technical
specification of the folder (like what appears in your configuration file)
or (much easier) the nickname that you gave the folder when you made it
an incoming folder.
<p>
For example:<p>
<CENTER><SAMP>{monet.art.example.com}inbox {monet.art.example.com}mail/inbox-archive</SAMP></CENTER>

With this option your actual signature, as opposed to
the name of a file containing your signature,
is stored in the Alpine configuration file.
If this is defined it takes precedence over the <!--#echo var="VAR_signature-file"--> option.
<P>

This is simply a different way to store the signature.
The signature is stored inside your Alpine configuration file instead of in
a separate file.
Tokens work the same way they do with the
<A HREF="h_config_signature_file"><!--#echo var="VAR_signature-file"--></A> so look there for
help.
<P>

The Setup/Signature command on Alpine's MAIN MENU will edit
the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_literal-signature"-->&quot; by default.  However, if no
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_literal-signature"-->&quot; is defined and the file named in the
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_signature-file"-->&quot; option exists, then the latter will be used
instead.
<P>

The two character sequence &#92;n (backslash followed by
the character n) will be used to signify a line-break in your signature.
You don't have to enter the &#92;n, but it will be visible in the
SETUP CONFIGURATION window after you are done editing the signature.

If a <A HREF="h_config_literal_sig"><!--#echo var="VAR_literal-signature"--></A> option is defined,

<P>
You may either use all Literal Signatures (signatures stored in your
configuration file) throughout Alpine, or all signature files.
You can't mix the two.
<P>
This is the name of a file that will be automatically inserted into
outgoing messages.
It typically contains information such as your
name, email address and organizational affiliation.
Alpine adds the
signature into the message as soon as you enter the composer so you
can choose to remove it or edit it on a message by message basis.
Signature file placement in message replies is controlled by the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_sig_at_bottom"><!--#echo var="FEAT_signature-at-bottom"--></A>&quot;
setting in the feature list.
<P>

The default file name is
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
&quot;PINE.SIG&quot; in the same directory as your PINERC file if your
PINERC file is a local file.
If your PINERC file is remote, then it will be in the directory specified
by the &quot;-aux local_directory&quot; command line option.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;.signature&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
<P>

To create or edit your signature file choose Setup from the MAIN MENU
and then select S for Signature (Main/Setup/Signature).  This puts you
into the Signature Editor where you can enter a <EM>few</EM> lines of
text containing your identity and affiliation.

<P>
If the filename is followed by a vertical bar (|) then instead
of reading the contents of the file the file is assumed to be a
program that will produce the text to be used on its standard output.
The program can't have any arguments and doesn't receive any input from Alpine,
but the rest of the processing works as if the contents came from a file.

<P>
Instead of storing the data in a local file, the
signature data may be stored remotely in an IMAP folder.
In order to do this, 
you must use a remote name for the file.
A remote <!--#echo var="VAR_signature-file"--> name might look like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us}mail/signature</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

The syntax used here is the same as the syntax used for remote configuration
files from the command line.
Note that you may not access an existing signature file remotely,
you have to create a new <EM>folder</EM> that contains the signature data.
If the name you use here for the signature file is a remote name, then when
you edit the file from the Setup/Signature command the data will be stored
remotely in the folder.
You aren't required to do anything special to create the folder, it
gets created automatically if you use a remote name.

<P>
Besides regular text, the signature file may also contain
(or a signature program may produce) tokens that
are replaced with text that usually depends on the message you are replying
to or forwarding.
For example, if the signature file contains the token
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
anywhere in the text, then that token is replaced by the date
the message you are replying to or forwarding was sent.
If it contains
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_CURDATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
that is replaced with the current date.
The first is an example of a token that depends on the message you
are replying to (or forwarding) and the second is an example which
doesn't depend on anything other than the current date.
You have to be a little careful with this facility since tokens that
depend on the message you are replying to or forwarding will be replaced
by nothing in the case where you are composing a new message from scratch.
The use of <A HREF="h_rules_roles">&quot;roles&quot;</A> may help you
in this respect.
It allows you to use different signature files in different cases.
<P>

The list of tokens available for use in the signature file is
<A HREF="h_index_tokens">here</A>.
<P>

Instead of, or along with the use of &quot;roles&quot; to give you
different signature files in different situations, there is also
a way to conditionally include text based
on whether or not a token would result in specific replacement text.
For example, you could include some text based on whether or not
the _NEWS_ token would result in any newsgroups if it was used.
This is explained in detail
<A HREF="h_reply_token_conditionals">here</A>.
This isn't for the faint of heart.
<P>
In the very unlikely event that you want to include a literal token
in the signature you must precede it with a backslash character.
For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#92;_DAYDATE_ = _DAYDATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would produce something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DAYDATE_ = Sat, 24 Oct 1998</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
It is not possible to have a literal backslash followed by an expanded token.
<P>
An alternate method for storing the signature data is available by using the
<A HREF="h_config_literal_sig"><!--#echo var="VAR_literal-signature"--></A> configuration option.
This variable will be used by default.

The initial keystroke--or command--list option lets you start Alpine at
any place you like.
Whatever keystrokes you specify here will be executed
by Alpine upon startup as a macro.
The words SPACE, TAB, DOWN, UP, LEFT, and
RIGHT indicate the pressing of those keys.
CR indicates the pressing of the RETURN key.
F1 through F12 represent the function keys, and ^ followed
by a character indicates that key pressed along with the control key (in
other words, ^P means Ctrl-P).
As a shortcut notation, an element of the list may be several characters
surrounded by double-quotes (").
That will be expanded into the individual keystrokes
(excluding the double-quote characters).
For example, the quoted-string

<P><CENTER>"ABC"</CENTER>

<P>
is interpreted the same as the three separate list members

<P><CENTER>A and B and C</CENTER>

<P>
which is also the same as

<P><CENTER>A,B,C</CENTER>

<P>
An example: To view message 1 on startup,
you could use an <!--#echo var="VAR_initial-keystroke-list"--> equal to

<P><CENTER>I,J,1,CR,V</CENTER>

An equivalent version of this is

You may add your own custom headers to outgoing messages.
Each header you specify here must include the header tag 
(<A HREF="h_composer_reply_to">Reply-To:</A>, Approved:, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.
If you want to see these custom headers each time you compose a message,
you must add them to your
<A HREF="h_config_comp_hdrs"><!--#echo var="VAR_default-composer-hdrs"--></A> list, 
otherwise they become part
of the rich header set that you only see when you press the
<A HREF="h_compose_richhdr">Rich Header</A>
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->(F5)
<!--chtml else-->(Ctrl-R)<!--chtml endif--> command.
(If you are looking for a way to change which headers are <EM>displayed</EM>
when you view a message, take a look at the
<A HREF="h_config_viewer_headers"><!--#echo var="VAR_viewer-hdrs"--></A>
option instead.)
Here's an example that shows how you might set your From address
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>From: Full Name &lt;user@example.com&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and another showing how you might set a Reply-To address
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Reply-To: user@example.com</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
You may also set non-standard header values here.
For example, you could add
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Organization: My Organization Name</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or even
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>X-Favorite-Colors: Purple and Gold</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If you include a value after the colon then that header will be included
in your outgoing messages unless you delete it before sending.
If a header in the <!--#echo var="VAR_customized-hdrs"--> list has only a tag but no value, then
it will not be included in outgoing messages unless you edit a value
in manually.
For example, if
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Reply-To:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
is in the list, then the Reply-To header will be available for editing
but won't be included unless a value is added while in the composer.
<P>
It's actually a little more complicated than that.
The values of headers that you set with the <!--#echo var="VAR_customized-hdrs"--> option are
defaults.
If the message you are about to compose already has a value for a header,
that value is used instead of a value from your <!--#echo var="VAR_customized-hdrs"-->.
For example, if you are Replying to a message the Subject field
will already be filled in.
In that case, if the <!--#echo var="VAR_customized-hdrs"--> list contains a Subject line, the
custom subject will <EM>NOT</EM> be used.
The subject derived from the subject of the message you are Replying
to will be used instead.
<P>
It is also possible to make header setting even more complicated and more
automatic by using
<A HREF="h_rules_roles">Roles</A>,
but if all you want to do is set a default value for a header, you don't
need to think about Roles.
<P>
If you change your From address you may also find it useful to add the
changed From address to the
<a href="h_config_alt_addresses"><!--#echo var="VAR_alt-addresses"--></a>
configuration option.
<P>
Limitation: Because commas are used to separate the list of
<!--#echo var="VAR_customized-hdrs"-->, it is not possible to have the value of a
header contain a comma.
Nor is there currently an &quot;escape&quot; mechanism provided
to make this work.

Its value is the number of space characters following each displayed line.
You may specify the column number to end the text in
(column numbering begins with number 1)
instead of the width of the margin by appending a lower case letter
&quot;c&quot; to the number.
For example, a value of &quot;76c&quot; means to end the text in column 76.
If the screen is 80 characters wide, this is equivalent to a value
of &quot;4&quot;, which means to leave a margin of 4 spaces.
However, if you use different size screens at different times, then these
two values are not equivalent.
<P>
The default right margin is 4.
Misconfigurations (for example, negative values or values with starting
left columns greater than the ending right column)
are silently ignored.
If the number of columns for text between the
<A HREF="h_config_viewer_margin_left"><!--#echo var="VAR_viewer-margin-left"--></A> and
the <!--#echo var="VAR_viewer-margin-right"--> is fewer than 8, then margins of zero will be used
instead.

<HEAD>
<TITLE>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_quote-suppression-threshold"--></TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_quote-suppression-threshold"--></H1>

This option should be used with care.
It will cause some of the quoted text to be eliminated from the
display when viewing a message in the MESSAGE TEXT screen.
For example, if you set the <!--#echo var="VAR_quote-suppression-threshold"--> to the
value &quot;5&quot;,
this will cause quoted text that is longer than five lines to be truncated.
Quoted text of five or fewer consecutive lines will be displayed in its entirety.
Quoted text of more than six lines will have the first five lines displayed
followed by a line that looks something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[ 12 lines of quoted text hidden from view ]</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
As a special case, if exactly one line of quoted text would be hidden, the
entire quote will be shown instead.
So for the above example, quoted text that is exactly six lines long will
will be shown in its entirety.
(In other words, instead of hiding a single line and adding a line
that announces that one line was hidden, the line is just shown.)
<P>
If the sender of a message has carefully chosen the quotes that he or she
includes, hiding those quotes may change the meaning of the message.
For that reason, Alpine requires that when you want to set the value of this
variable to something less than four lines, you actually have to set it
to the negative of that number.
So if you want to set this option to &quot;3&quot;, you actually have to
set it to &quot;-3&quot;.
The only purpose of this is to get you to think about whether or not you
really want to do this!
If you want to delete all quoted text you set the value of this option
to the special value &quot;-10&quot;.
<P>
The legal values for this option are
<P>
<TABLE>   
<TR>
  <TD> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD>
  <TD> Default, don't hide anything </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD> &nbsp;-1,-2,-3&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD>
  <TD> Suppress quote lines past 1, 2, or 3 lines </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD> &nbsp;4,5,6,...&nbsp; </TD>
  <TD> Suppress if more than that many lines </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD>
  <TD> Suppress all quoted lines </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
If you set this option to a non-default value you may sometimes wish to
view the quoted text that is not shown.
When this is the case, the
<A HREF="h_common_hdrmode">HdrMode Command</A>
may be used to show the hidden text.
Typing the &quot;H&quot; command once will show the hidden text.
Typing a second &quot;H&quot; will also turn on Full Header mode.
The presence or absence of the HdrMode command is determined by the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_full_hdr">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-full-header-cmd"-->&quot;</A>
Feature-List option in your Alpine configuration, so you will want to
be sure that is turned on if you use quote suppression.
<P>
For the purposes of this option, a quote is a line that begins with the
character &quot;&gt;&quot;.
<P>
Quotes are only suppressed when displaying a message on the screen.
The entire quote will be left intact when printing or forwarding or something
similar.

<TITLE>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_saved-msg-name-rule"--></TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_saved-msg-name-rule"--></H1>

This option determines the default folder name when saving
a message.

<P>
The default option is &quot;default-folder&quot;, which is the folder
called &quot;saved-messages&quot; in Unix Alpine and
&quot;savemail&quot; in PC-Alpine.  To change the default folder, modify
the Alpine option called
<A HREF="h_config_def_save_folder">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_default-saved-msg-folder"-->&quot;</A>.

<P>
Choosing any of the &quot;by-&quot; options cause Alpine to attempt to
get the chosen option's value for the message being saved (or for the
first message being saved if using an aggregrate save).
For example, if &quot;by-from&quot; is chosen, Alpine attempts to get the
value of who the message came from (i.e. the from address).
Alpine then attempts to save the message to a folder matching that value.
If &quot;by-from&quot; is chosen and no value is obtained, Alpine uses
&quot;by-sender&quot;.
The opposite is also true.
If &quot;by-recipient&quot; is chosen and the message was posted to a
newsgroup, Alpine will use the newsgroup name.
If &quot;by-replyto&quot; is chosen and no value is obtained, Alpine uses
&quot;by-from&quot;.

<P>
If any of the &quot;by-realname&quot; options are chosen, Alpine will attempt
to use the personal name part of the address instead of the mailbox part.
If any of the &quot;by-nick&quot; options are chosen, the
address is looked up in your address book and if found, the
nickname for that entry is used.
Only simple address book entries are checked, not distribution lists.
Similarly, if any of the
&quot;by-fcc&quot; options are chosen, the fcc from the corresponding
address book entry is used.
If by-realname, or the by-nick or by-fcc lookups result in no value,
then if the chosen option ends with the &quot;then-from&quot;,
&quot;then-sender&quot;, &quot;then-replyto&quot;,
or &quot;then-recip&quot; suffix, Alpine
reverts to the same behavior as &quot;by-from&quot;,
&quot;by-sender&quot;, &quot;by-replyto&quot;, or &quot;by-recip&quot;
depending on which option was specified.
If the chosen option doesn't end with one of
the &quot;then-&quot; suffixes, then Alpine reverts to the default
folder when no match is found in the address book.

<P>
Choosing the option called &quot;last-folder-used&quot;, causes Alpine
to save to the folder that you saved to the last time you saved a
message.  The first time you save a message in an Alpine session, Alpine
attempts to save the message to the default folder.

<P>
Here is an example to make some of the options clearer.
If the message is From
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Fred Flintstone &lt;flint@bedrock.org&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and this rule is set to &quot;by-from&quot;, then the default folder offered
in the save dialog would be &quot;flint&quot;.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-realname-of-from&quot; then the default would
be &quot;Fred Flintstone&quot;.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-nick-of-from&quot; then Alpine will search
for the address &quot;flint@bedrock.org&quot; in your address book.
If an entry is found and it has a nickname associated with it, that nickname
will be offered as the default folder.
If not, the default saved message folder will be offered as the default.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-fcc-of-from&quot; then Alpine will search
for the address &quot;flint@bedrock.org&quot; in your address book.
If an entry is found and it has an Fcc associated with it, that Fcc
will be offered as the default folder.
If not, the default saved message folder will be offered as the default.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-nick-of-from-then-from&quot; then Alpine will search
for the address &quot;flint@bedrock.org&quot; in your address book.
If an entry is found and it has a nickname associated with it, that nickname
will be offered as the default folder.
If it is not found (or has no nickname) then the default offered will be
the same as it would be for the &quot;by-from&quot; rule.
That is, it would be &quot;flint&quot;

will extract the recipient name from the address and use that (like
by-recipient).
</DD>

<DT>current-folder</DT>
<DD>Causes a copy to be written to

If you use an address book from more than one computer and those

made.
There are two reasons the sorting might be different on different
systems.
First, the <!--#echo var="VAR_addrbook-sort-rule"--></a> may be set differently in the two
places.
Second, the collation rules on the two computers may be different.
For example, one system might ignore special characters while the other
doesn't or one may sort upper and lower case letters together while
the other doesn't.
In any case, the order you see is the order on the system where the
last change was made, for example by an address book edit or a
Take Address command.

The <!--#echo var="VAR_posting-character-set"--> configuration option is used
when sending messages.

<P>

When sending a message the text typed in the composer is
labeled with the character set specified by this option.
If the composed text is not fully representable in the 
specified <!--#echo var="VAR_posting-character-set"-->, then it is labeled as &quot;UTF-8.&quot
instead;

<P>
Attachments are labeled with your
<A HREF="h_config_key_char_set">&quot;Keyboard Character Set&quot;</A>.

<P>
Generally, there should be little need to set this option.
If left unset, the
default behavior is to label composed text as specifically as
possible.  That is, if the composed text has no non-ASCII characters,
it is labeled as &quot;US-ASCII.&quot; Similarly, if it is composed of
only ISO-8859-15 characters, it is labeled as such.  Alpine will
attempt to automatically detect a number of character sets including ISO-8859-15,
ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, VISCII, KOI8-R, KOI8-U, ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-6,
ISO-8859-8, TIS-620, ISO-2022-JP, GB2312, BIG5, and EUC-KR.
If the message contains a mix of character sets,
it is labeled as &quot;UTF-8.&quot;

<P>

This setting is provided to allow you to force a particular character set that
Alpine does not automatically detect. For example, if a message is representable
in more than one character set then Alpine may choose a different default
than you want.
Lastly, by setting this option explicitly to
&quot;UTF-8&quot; all non-ASCII messages you send will be labeled as
&quot;UTF-8&quot; instead of something more specific.

<P>
In the Setup/Config screen you may choose from a list of all the

<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_unknown-character-set"--></H1>

The <!--#echo var="VAR_unknown-character-set"--> configuration option is used
when reading or replying to messages.

<P>

A text message should either be made up of all US-ASCII characters
or it should contain a charset label which tells the software which
character set encoding to use to interpret the message.
Sometimes a malformed message may be unlabeled but contain non-ascii text.
This message is outside of the standards so any attempt to read it could fail.
When Alpine attempts to read such a message it will try to interpret the
text in the character set you specify here.
For example, if you have correspondents who send you unlabeled messages that
are usually made up of characters from the WINDOWS-1251 character set, setting
this <!--#echo var="VAR_unknown-character-set"--> to <CODE>WINDOWS-1251</CODE> will
allow you to read those messages.
Of course, if the unlabeled message is actually in some other character set,
then you may see garbage on your screen.
<P>
Instead of just unlabeled text, this option also affects text which is labeled
with the charsets &quot;X-Unknown&quot;, &quot;MISSING_PARAMETER_VALUE&quot;
or &quot;US-ASCII&quot;.

<TITLE>OPTION: Display Character Set</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Display Character Set</H1>

The Display Character Set configuration option is used when viewing messages.
<P>
Alpine uses Unicode characters internally and 
it is a goal for Alpine to handle email in many different languages.
Alpine will properly display only left-to-right character sets
in a fixed-width font. Specifically, Alpine assumes that a fixed-width
font is in use, in the sense that
characters are assumed to take up zero, one, or two character cell
widths from left to right on the screen. This is true even in PC-Alpine.
<P>

Alpine recognizes some local character sets that are right-to-left
(Arabic, Hebrew, and Thai) or not representable in a fixed-width font
(Arabic) and properly converts texts in these character sets to/from
Unicode; however, there are known display bugs with these character
sets.
<P>

There are three possible configuration character settings and some
environment variable settings that can affect how Alpine
handles international characters.
The first two of these are only available in UNIX Alpine.
The three configuration options are
Display Character Set,
Keyboard Character Set, and
<!--#echo var="VAR_posting-character-set"-->.
The Keyboard Character Set defaults to being the same value
as the Display Character Set, and that is usually correct, because
the keyboard almost always produces characters in the same character set
as the display displays.
The Display Character Set is the character set that Alpine
will attempt to use when sending characters to the display.
<P>

By default, the Display Character Set variable is not set and UNIX Alpine
will attempt to get this information from the environment.
In particular, the <CODE>nl_langinfo(CODESET)</CODE> call is used.
This usually depends on the setting of the environment variables LANG or LC_CTYPE.
An explicit configuration setting for Display Character Set will,
of course, override any default setting.
<P>
For PC-Alpine the Display Character Set
and the Keyboard Character Set
are always equivalent to <CODE>UTF-8</CODE> and this is not settable.
<P>

It is probably best to use UNIX Alpine in a terminal emulator
capable of displaying UTF-8 characters, since that will allow you to
view just about any received text that is correctly formatted (note,
however, the above comments about known index display bugs with certain
character sets). You'll need to have an emulator that uses a UTF-8 font
and you'll need to set up your environment to use a UTF-8 charmap. For
example, on a Linux system you might include
<P>
<CENTER> <CODE>setenv LANG en_US.UTF-8</CODE> </CENTER>
<P>

or something similar in your UNIX startup files.
You'd also have to select a UTF-8 font in your terminal emulator.
<P>

The types of values that the character set variables may be set to are
<CODE>UTF-8</CODE>, <CODE>ISO-8859-1</CODE>, or <CODE>EUC-JP</CODE>.
The <CODE>ISO-2022</CODE> character sets are not supported for input or
for display, but as a special case, <CODE>ISO-2022-JP</CODE> is supported
for use only as a <!--#echo var="VAR_posting-character-set"-->.
In the Setup/Config screen you may choose from a list of all the
character sets Alpine knows about by using the &quot;T&quot; ToCharsets command.

<P>

When reading incoming email, Alpine understands many different
character sets and is able to convert the incoming mail into Unicode.
The Unicode will be converted to the Display Character Set
for display on your terminal.
Characters typed at the keyboard will be converted from the
Keyboard Character Set to Unicode for Alpine's internal
use.
You may find that you can read some malformed messages that do not
contain a character set label by setting the option
<A HREF="h_config_unk_char_set">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_unknown-character-set"-->&quot;</A>.
<P>

The <!--#echo var="VAR_posting-character-set"--> is used when sending messages.
The default behavior obtained by leaving this variable unset is usually
what is wanted. In that default case, Alpine will attempt
to label the message with the most specific character set from the
rather arbitrary set
<P>
US-ASCII, ISO-8859-15,
ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, VISCII, KOI8-R, KOI8-U, ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-6,
ISO-8859-8, TIS-620, ISO-2022-JP, GB2312, BIG5, EUC-KR, and UTF-8.
<P>

For example, if the message is made up of only US-ASCII characters, it
will be labeled US-ASCII. Otherwise, if it is all ISO-8859-15 characters,
that will be the label. If that doesn't work the same is tried for the
remaining members of the list.

<P>
It might make sense to set <!--#echo var="VAR_posting-character-set"--> to an
explicit value instead.
For example, if you usually send messages in Greek, setting this
option to ISO-8859-7 will result in messages being labeled as
US-ASCII if there are no non-ascii characters, ISO-8859-7 if there
are only Greek characters, or UTF-8 if there are some characters
that aren't representable in ISO-8859-7.
Another possibility is to set this option explicitly to UTF-8.
In that case
Alpine labels only ascii messages as US-ASCII and all other
messages as UTF-8.
<P>

The options
<A HREF="h_config_post_char_set">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_posting-character-set"-->&quot;</A>
and <A HREF="h_config_key_char_set">&quot;Keyboard Character Set&quot;</A>
are closely related to this option.
Setting the feature
<A HREF="h_config_use_system_translation">&quot;Use System Translation&quot;</A>
should cause this option to be ignored.

<P>
When displaying a message, Alpine compares this setting to the character
set specified in the message.  If not all of the
characters in the message can be displayed using the Display Character Set
then Alpine places an editorial
comment in the displayed text (enclosed in square-brackets) indicating
that some characters may not be displayed correctly.
This comment may be eliminated by turning on the option
<A HREF="h_config_quell_charset_warning"><!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-charset-warning"--></A>.

The Keyboard Character Set identifies the character set of the characters
coming from your keyboard.
It defaults to having the same value as your
<A HREF="h_config_char_set">&quot;Display Character Set&quot;</A>,
which in turn defaults to a value obtained from your environment.
It is unlikely that you will need to use this option, because the keyboard
almost always produces the same kind of characters as the display displays.

<P>
This character set is also used when accessing files in your local
file system.
The names of the files are assumed to be in the same character set as
what the keyboard produces, as well as the contents of the files.

<P>
In the Setup/Config screen you may choose from a list of all the
character sets Alpine knows about by using the &quot;T&quot; ToCharsets command.

<!--#echo var="VAR_editor"--> specifies the program invoked by ^_ in the Composer. This is

this setting to specify an alternate editor to use occasionally or if you
have a favorite editor and want to use it all the time (see the 
<A HREF="h_config_alt_ed_now">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-alternate-editor-implicitly"-->&quot;</A> setting).  <P>
If you specify multiple editors for this option, ^_ will invoke the first one 
of those specified that exists and is executable.  When specifying a program 
for use here, make sure that the format of the text it saves -- which, when 
you exit it, will become the message body in Alpine -- is appropriate 
for the body of an email message; avoid proprietary formats that may result in 
a message body that the recipient of your message will be unable to decipher.

Note that if <a href="h_config_quell_flowed_text"><!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-flowed-text"--></a> is

For PC-Alpine, you must install the aspell library code that you
may get from
<A HREF="http://aspell.net/win32/">http://aspell.net/win32/</A>.
<P>
This option affects the behavior of the ^T (spell check) command in the
Composer.  It specifies the program invoked by ^T in the Composer.
By default, Alpine uses
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>aspell --dont-backup --mode=email check</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
if it knows where to find &quot;aspell&quot;.
If there is no &quot;aspell&quot; command available but the command &quot;ispell&quot; is available
then the command used is
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>ispell -l</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Otherwise, the ancient &quot;spell&quot; command is used.
<P>
If you specify a value for this command (with full pathname) then that is what
will be used instead of any of the defaults.
When invoking this
spell-checking program, Alpine appends a tempfile name (where the message is
passed) to the command line. Alpine expects the speller to correct the
spelling in that file. When you exit from that program Alpine will read the
tempfile back into the composer.
<P>
Don't set this speller option to the standard Unix spell command.
That won't work because spell works in a different way.

This option defines a list of text-filtering commands (programs or
scripts) that may be used to filter text portions of received messages
prior to their use (e.g., presentation in the &quot;MESSAGE TEXT&quot;
display screen, exporting to a text file).  
For security reasons, the full path name of the
filter command must be specified.

<P>
The command is executed and the message is piped into its standard input. 
The standard output of the command is read back by Alpine.  The
&quot;_TMPFILE_&quot; token (see below) overrides this default behavior. 

<P> 
The filter's use is based on the configured &quot;trigger&quot; string.  The
format of a filter definition is:

<P>   
<CENTER>&lt;trigger&gt; &lt;command&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;</CENTER>

<P>
You can specify as many filters as you wish, separating them with a comma.  
Each filter can have only one trigger and command.  Thus, two trigger 
strings that invoke the same command require separate filter 
specifications. 

<P> 
The &quot;trigger&quot; is simply text that, if found in the message,
will invoke the associated command.  If the trigger contains any space
characters, it must be placed within quotes.  Likewise, should you
wish a filter to be invoked unconditionally, define the trigger as the
null string, &quot;&quot; (two consecutive double-quote characters).  If the
trigger string is found anywhere in the text of the message the filter
is invoked.  Placing the trigger text within the tokens defined below
changes where within the text the trigger must be before considering
it a match.

<P>  
Trigger Modifying Tokens:
<DL>
<DT>_CHARSET(<VAR>string</VAR>)_</DT>
<DD>This token tells Alpine to invoke the supplied command
if the text is in a character set matching <VAR>string</VAR>
(e.g., ISO-8859-2 or ISO-2022-JP).
</DD>


<DT>_LEADING(<VAR>string</VAR>)_</DT>
<DD>This token tells Alpine to invoke the supplied command
if the enclosed <VAR>string</VAR> is found to be the first
non-whitespace text.
<BR>NOTE: Quotes are necessary if <VAR>string</VAR> contains
the space character.
</DD>

<DT>_BEGINNING(<VAR>string</VAR>)_</DT>
<DD>This token tells Alpine to invoke the supplied command
if the enclosed <VAR>string</VAR> is found at the beginning
of any line in the text.
<BR>NOTE: Quotes are necessary if <VAR>string</VAR> contains
the space character.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The &quot;command&quot; and &quot;arguments&quot; portion is simply
the command line to be invoked if the trigger string is found.  Below
are tokens that Alpine will recognize and replace with special values
when the command is actually invoked.

<P>
Command Modifying Tokens:

<DL>
<DT>_TMPFILE_</DT>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is 
replaced with the path and name of the temporary 
file containing the text to be filtered.  Alpine 
expects the filter to replace this data with the 
filter's result.

<P>
NOTE: Use of this token implies that the text to 
be filtered is not piped into standard input of the 
executed command and its standard output is ignored. 
Alpine restores the tty modes before invoking the
filter in case the filter interacts with the user
via its own standard input and output.  
</DD>
                        
<DT>_RESULTFILE_</DT>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is 
replaced with the path and name of a temporary 
file intended to contain a status message from the 
filter.  Alpine displays this in the message status 
field. 
</DD>
 
<DT>_DATAFILE_</DT>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is 
replaced with the path and name of a temporary 
file that Alpine creates once per session and deletes 
upon exit.  The file is intended to be used by the 
filter to store state information between instances 
of the filter.
</DD>
   
<DT>_PREPENDKEY_</DT>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token indicates that a random
number will be passed down the input stream before the message text.
This number could be used as a session key.  It is sent in this way to
improve security.  The number is unique to the current Alpine session
and is only generated once per session.
</DD>

<DT>_SILENT_</DT>
<DD>When the filter is executed, this token tells Alpine not to repaint
the screen while the command is being executed. This can be used with 
filters that do not interact with the user, and therefore repainting 
the screen is not necessary. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The feature
<A HREF="h_config_disable_reset_disp"><!--#echo var="FEAT_disable-terminal-reset-for-display-filters"--></A> is related.
<P>
Performance caveat/considerations:
<BR>
Testing for the trigger and invoking the filter doesn't come for free.
There is overhead associated with searching for the trigger string, testing
for the filter's existence and actually piping the text through the filter.
The impact can be reduced if the Trigger Modifying Tokens above are 
employed.

====== h_config_keywords =====
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></H1>

You may define your own set of keywords and optionally set them on a
message by message basis.
These are similar to the &quot;Important&quot; flag which the user
may set using the Flag command.
The difference is that the Important flag is always present for each folder.
User-defined keywords are chosen by the user.
You may set up the list of possible keywords here, or you may add keywords
from the Flag Details screen that you
can get to after typing the
Flag (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F11<!--chtml else-->*<!--chtml endif-->)
command.
After the keywords have been defined,
then you use the <A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag command</A>
to set or clear the keywords in each message.
The behavior of the flag command may be modified by using the
<A HREF="h_config_flag_screen_default">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-flag-screen-implicitly"-->&quot;</A> option or the
<A HREF="h_config_flag_screen_kw_shortcut">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-flag-screen-keyword-shortcut"-->&quot;</A> option.

<P>
Keywords may be used when Selecting messages (Select Keyword).
Keywords may also be used in the Patterns of Rules (Filters, Indexcolors, etc).
Filter Rules may be used to set keywords automatically.
Keywords may be displayed as part of the Subject of a message by using
the SUBJKEY or SUBJKEYINIT tokens in the
<A HREF="h_config_index_format"><!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--></A> option.
The <A HREF="h_config_kw_braces"><!--#echo var="VAR_keyword-surrounding-chars"--></A>
option may be used to modify the display of keywords using
SUBJKEY and SUBJKEYINIT slightly.
Keywords may also be displayed in a column of their own in the MESSAGE INDEX
screen by using the KEY or KEYINIT tokens.
It is also possible to color keywords in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
Keywords are not supported by all mail servers.

<P>
You may give keywords nicknames if you wish.
If the keyword definition you type in contains a SPACE character, then the
actual value of the keyword is everything after the last SPACE and the
nickname for that keyword is everything before the last SPACE.
For example, suppose you are trying to interoperate with another email program
that uses a particular keyword with an unpleasant name.
Maybe it uses a keyword called
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>VendorName.SoftwareName.08</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
but for you that keyword means that the message is work-related.
You could define a keyword to have the value
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Work VendorName.SoftwareName.08</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and then you would use the name &quot;Work&quot; when dealing with
that keyword in Alpine.
If you defined it as
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>My Work VendorName.SoftwareName.08</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
the nickname would be everything before the last SPACE, that is the nickname
would be &quot;My Work&quot;.
<P>
Some commonly used keywords begin with dollar signs.
This presents a slight complication, because the dollar sign is normally used
to signify
<A HREF="h_news_config">environment variable expansion</A>
in the Alpine configuration.
In order to specify a keyword that begins with a dollar sign you must
precede the dollar sign with a second dollar sign to escape its special
meaning.
For example, if you want to include the keyword
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>$Label1</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
as one of your possible keywords, you must enter the text
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>$$Label1</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

instead.
<P>
There are a couple limitations.
First, not all servers support keywords.
Second, some servers (including the IMAP server included with Alpine)
have a per folder limit on the number of keywords that may be defined.
This count commonly includes every keyword you have ever used in the
folder, even if it is no longer being used.
In other words, you can add keywords but you cannot remove them easily.
If you have changed keywords over the life of a folder and find that
you have reached such a limit, one possible solution might be to copy
all of the messages to a newly created folder (using Alpine) and then
delete the original and rename the new folder.
The reason this might work is that only the keywords currently set in
any of the messages will be used in the new folder, hopefully putting you
under the limit.

<HEAD>
<TITLE>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_alt-addresses"--></TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_alt-addresses"--></H1>

This option provides a place for you to list alternate email addresses
you may have.
Each address in the list should be the actual email address part of an
address, without the full name field or the angle brackets.
For example:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>user@example.com</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

The matching is case-insensitive, so this would match any of
<SAMP>User@example.com</SAMP>, <SAMP>user@Example.Com</SAMP>, or
<SAMP>USER@EXAMPLE.COM</SAMP> as well.

<P>
If set, the option affects the behavior of the Reply
command and the &quot;+&quot; symbol in the MESSAGE INDEX, which denotes that
a message has been addressed specifically to you.

<P>
In the default INDEX display
the personal name (or email address) of
the person listed in the message's &quot;From:&quot; header
field is usually displayed except when that address is yours or one of your
alternate addresses.
In that case you will usually see the name of
the first person specified in the
message's &quot;To:&quot; header field
with the prefix &quot;To: &quot; prepended.

<P>
With respect to Reply, the reply-to-all option will exclude addresses
listed here.

<P>
The feature
<A HREF="h_config_copy_to_to_from"><!--#echo var="FEAT_copy-to-address-to-from-if-it-is-us"--></A>
is somewhat related to this option.

<P>
In addition to a list of actual addresses,
you may use regular expressions (as used with egrep with the ignore case flag)
to describe the addresses you want to match.
Alpine will somewhat arbitrarily interpret your entry as a regular
expression if it contains any of the characters
*, |, +, ?, {, [, ^, $, or &#92;.
Otherwise, it will be treated literally.
The feature
<a href="h_config_disable_regex"><!--#echo var="FEAT_disable-regular-expression-matching-for-alternate-addresses"--></a>
may be used to turn off regular expression processing regardless of whether or not
special characters appear in the entry.

<P>
A description of how regular expressions work is beyond the
scope of this help text, but some examples follow.

<P>
The entry

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>.*@example.com</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

in the <!--#echo var="VAR_alt-addresses"--> list would mean that any
address with a domain name of <SAMP>example.com</SAMP> (such as
<SAMP>fred@example.com</SAMP> or <SAMP>wilma@example.com</SAMP>) will be considered
one of your alternate addresses.
Strictly speaking, the dot in <SAMP>example.com</SAMP> ought to be escaped with
a backslash, as in <SAMP>example&#92;.com</SAMP>, and a dollar sign anchor ought
to come at the end of the expression to prevent a match of <SAMP>example.com.org</SAMP>.
Complicating things further, the dollar sign
is special in the Alpine configuration (it signifies environment variable expansion)
so the dollar sign should be doubled or backslash escaped for Alpine's sake.
Quotes around the whole expression will not escape the dollar sign successfully.
So this example should look like

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>.*@example&#92;.com$$</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

<P>
The entry

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>^fred[0-9]*@example.com$$</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

would match
<SAMP>fred3@example.com</SAMP> or <SAMP>fred17@example.com</SAMP> as well
as <SAMP>fred@example.com</SAMP>.

<P>
You could match all addresses that look like
<SAMP>fred+stuff@example.com</SAMP> for any value of <SAMP>stuff</SAMP> with the
entry

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>^fred&#92;+.*@example.com$$</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Notice that you have to escape the plus sign with a backslash because plus
is a special character in regular expressions.
If you wanted to match plain <SAMP>fred</SAMP> as well as <SAMP>fred+stuff</SAMP>
the expression

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>^fred(()|&#92;+.*)@example.com$$</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

would do it, but it would be easier to just add fred@example.com as a
separate entry.

<P>
One more example, a match of all first-level subdomains, is given by

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>^fred@[[:alnum:]_-]*&#92;.example&#92;.com$$</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

<P>
Because the regular expression matching is based on an old library
(<SAMP>hs_regex</SAMP>) the regular expressions might not work exactly as you expect,
but they should be close.

<TITLE>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_addressbook-formats"--></TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_addressbook-formats"--></H1>

This option specifies the format that address books are displayed in.
Normally, address books are displayed with the nicknames in the first
column, the fullnames in the second column, and addresses in the third
column.  The system figures out reasonable defaults for the widths of
the columns.  An address book may be given a different format by
listing special tokens in the order you want them to display.  The
possible tokens are NICKNAME, FULLNAME, ADDRESS, FCC, and COMMENT.
So, for example, to get the default behavior you could list

<P>
<CENTER><!--#echo var="VAR_addressbook-formats"-->=NICKNAME FULLNAME ADDRESS</CENTER>

<P>
(You can also use the token DEFAULT to get the default behavior for
an address book format.)

<P>
The tokens are separated by spaces.  &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_addressbook-formats"-->&quot;
is a list, so if you have more than one address book you may have a
separate format for each by putting its format at the corresponding
location in the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_addressbook-formats"-->&quot; list.

<P>

Listed first are the personal address books, then the global address
books.  So, if you have two personal address books and one global
address book, you may have up to three formats in the
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_addressbook-formats"-->&quot; list.  If
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_addressbook-formats"-->&quot; doesn't have as many elements as there
are address books, the last element is used repeatedly.

<P>

Each of the tokens may also be optionally followed by parentheses with
either a number or a percentage inside the parentheses.  For example,
<SAMP>FULLNAME(13)</SAMP> means to allocate 13 characters of space to
the fullnames column, <SAMP>FULLNAME(20%)</SAMP> means to allocate 20%
of the available space (the screen width minus the space for
inter-column spaces) to the fullnames column, while plain
<SAMP>FULLNAME</SAMP> means the system will attempt to figure out a
reasonable number of columns.

<P>
There are always 2 spaces between every column, so if you use
fixed column widths (like 13) you should remember to take that into
account.

This option is used to customize the content of lines in the
<A HREF="h_mail_index">MESSAGE INDEX screen</A>.  Each line is intended 
to convey some amount of immediately relevant information about each 
message in the current folder.
<P>

Alpine provides a pre-defined set of informational fields with
reasonable column widths automatically computed.  You can, however,
replace this default set by listing special tokens in the order you
want them displayed.
<P>

The list of available tokens is
<A HREF="h_index_tokens">here</A>.
<P>

Spaces are used to separate listed tokens.  Additionally, you can
specify how much of the screen's width the token's associated data
should occupy on the index line by appending to the token a pair of
parentheses enclosing either a number or percentage.  For example,
&quot;SUBJECT(13)&quot; means to allocate 13 characters of space to the subject
column, and &quot;SUBJECT(20%)&quot; means to
allocate 20% of the available space
to the subjects column, while plain &quot;SUBJECT&quot; means the system will
attempt to figure out a reasonable amount of space.
<P>

There is always one space between every pair of columns, so if you use fixed
column widths (like 13) you should remember to take that into account.
Several of the fields are virtually fixed-width, so it doesn't make
much sense to specify the width for them.  The fields STATUS,
FULLSTATUS, IMAPSTATUS, MSGNO, the DATE fields, SIZE,
and DESCRIPSIZE all fall into that category.
You <EM>may</EM> specify widths for those if you wish, but
you're probably better off letting the system pick those widths.  <P>

<P>
The default is equivalent to:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>STATUS MSGNO SMARTDATETIME24 FROMORTO(33%) SIZENARROW SUBJKEY(67%)</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
This means that the four fields without percentages will be allocated
first, and then 33% and 67% of the <EM>remaining</EM> space will go to
the from and subject fields.  If one of those two fields is specified
as a percentage and the other is left for the system to choose, then
the percentage is taken as an absolute percentage of the screen, not
of the space remaining after allocating the first four columns.  It
doesn't usually make sense to do it that way.  If you leave off all
the widths, then the subject and from fields (if both are present) are
allocated space in a 2 to 1 ratio, which is almost exactly the same as
the default.

<P>
What you are most likely to do with this configuration option is to
specify which fields appear at all, which order they appear in, and the
percentage of screen that is used for the from and subject fields if you
don't like the 2 to 1 default.

<P>
If you want to retain the default format that Pine 4.64 had, use

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP><!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"-->=STATUS MSGNO DATE FROMORTO(33%) SIZE SUBJKEY(67%)</SAMP></CENTER>

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"--></H1>

This option is used to customize the content of the introduction line
that is included when replying to a message and including the original
message in the reply.
The normal default (what you will get if you delete this variable) looks
something like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On Sat, 24 Oct 1998, Fred Flintstone wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where the day of the week is only included if it is available in the
original message.
You can replace this default with text of your own.
The text may contain tokens that are replaced with text
that depends on the message you are replying to.
For example, the default is equivalent to:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On _DAYDATE_, _FROM_ wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Since this variable includes regular text mixed with special tokens
the tokens have to be surrounded by underscore characters.
For example, to use the token &quot;<SAMP>PREFDATE</SAMP>&quot;
you would need to use &quot;<SAMP>_PREFDATE_</SAMP>&quot;,
not &quot;<SAMP>PREFDATE</SAMP>&quot;.
<P>
The list of available tokens is
<A HREF="h_index_tokens">here</A>.

<P>
By default, the text is all on a single line and is followed by a blank line.
If your &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"-->&quot; turns out to be longer
than 80 characters when replying to a particular message, it is shortened.
However, if you use the token
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_NEWLINE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

anywhere in the value, no end of line or blank line is appended, and no
shortening is done.
The _NEWLINE_ token may be used to get rid of the blank line following
the text, to add more blank lines, or to form a multi-line
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"-->&quot;.
To clarify how _NEWLINE_ works recall that the default value is:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On _DAYDATE_, _FROM_ wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

That is equivalent to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On _DAYDATE_, _FROM_ wrote:_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

In the former case, two newlines are added automatically because
no _NEWLINE_ token appears in the value of the option (for backwards
compatibility). In the latter case, the newlines are explicit.
If you want to remove the blank line that follows the
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"-->&quot; text use a single
_NEWLINE_ token like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On _DAYDATE_, _FROM_ wrote:_NEWLINE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Because of the backwards compatibility problem, it is not possible to
remove all of the ends of lines, because then there will be no _NEWLINE_ tokens
and that will cause the automatic adding of two newlines!
If you want, you may embed newlines in the middle of the text, as well,
producing a multi-line &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-leadin"-->&quot;.

<P>
By default, no attempt is made to localize the date.
If you prefer a localized form you may find that one of the tokens
_PREFDATE_ or _PREFDATETIME_ is a satisfactory substitute.
If you want more control one of the many other date tokens, such as _DATEISO_,
might be better.

<P>
For the adventurous, there is a way to conditionally include text based
on whether or not a token would result in specific replacement text.
For example, you could include some text based on whether or not
the _NEWS_ token would result in any newsgroups if it was used.
It's explained in detail
<A HREF="h_reply_token_conditionals">here</A>.

<P>
In the very unlikely event that you want to include a literal token
in the introduction line you must precede it with a backslash character.
For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#92;_DAYDATE_ = _DAYDATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would produce something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DAYDATE_ = Sat, 24 Oct 1998</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
It is not possible to have a literal backslash followed by an expanded token.

An old copy can be put back into use by

If Alpine is
in the midst of composing a message or is waiting for user response to
a question, then it will not timeout.
However, if Alpine is sitting idle waiting for

input for this many hours, Alpine will exit.
No expunging or moving of read

It will exit similarly to the way it would exit

This may be useful for cleaning up unused Alpine sessions that have been

</UL>
<P>

The <EM>mbox</EM> driver enables the following behavior: if there is a
file called <CODE>mbox</CODE>
in your home directory, and if that file is either empty or in Unix mailbox
format, then every time you open <EM>INBOX</EM> the <EM>mbox</EM> driver
will automatically transfer mail from the system mail spool directory into the
<CODE>mbox</CODE> file and
delete it from the spool directory. If you disable the <EM>mbox</EM> driver,
this will not happen.
<P>

It is not recommended to disable the driver that supports the system default
mailbox format. On most non-SCO systems, that driver is the
<EM>unix</EM> driver.
On most SCO systems, it is the <EM>mmdf</EM> driver.
The system default driver may be
configured to something else on your system; check with your system manager
for additional information.
<P>

It is most likely not very useful for you to disable any of the drivers other
than possibly <EM>mbox</EM>.
You could disable some of the others if you know for
certain that you don't need them but the performance gain in doing so
is very modest.

This variable is a list of SASL (Simple Authentication and Security
Layer) authenticators that will be disabled.
SASL is a mechanism for
authenticating to IMAP, POP3, SMTP, and other network servers.
<P>

Alpine matches its list of supported authenticators with the server to
determine the most secure authenticator that is supported by both.
If no matching authenticators are found, Alpine will revert to plaintext
login (or, in the case of SMTP, will be unable to authenticate at all).
<P>
The candidates for disabling can be found <A HREF="X-Alpine-Config:">here</A>.
<P>

Normally, you will not disable any authenticators.
There are two exceptions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> You use a broken server that advertises an authenticator,
but does not actually implement it.
<LI> You have a Kerberos-capable version of Alpine and the server is
also Kerberos-capable, but you can not obtain Kerberos
credentials on the server machine, thus you desire to disable
GSSAPI (which in turn disables Alpine's Kerberos support).
</OL>
<P>
It is never necessary to disable authenticators, since Alpine will try
other authenticators before giving up.
However, disabling the relevant authenticator avoids annoying error messages.

<HEAD>
<TITLE>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_encryption-protocol-range"--></TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_encryption-protocol-range"--></H1>

This option sets a range of encryption protocols that can be attempted when
Alpine will try to establish a secure connection using the SSL or TLS
protocols.

<P>
Before a secure connection to an external server is established, Alpine and the
server will attempt to negotiate a secure connection. This part is known as the
&quot;ClientHello&quot;. At that time Alpine will announce the version of
encryption that it would like to establish. The server can reject that, and announce
a different version of encryption. Once both the server and Alpine have found
a version of encryption that they both agree on, they will both use it to start
a secure connection.

<P>
The use of the /ssl parameter in the definition of the server will make Alpine
attempt the highest encryption protocol that it can use, in agreement with the
server. However, using this option, you will set limits to the versions of
the protocols that are used. This would, for example, allow you to disable the use
of ssl3, in favor of more modern protocols. 

<P>
For purposes of this option, the protocols are sorted 
as follows

<P>
<CENTER>
no_min < ssl3 < tls1 < tls1_1 < tls1_2 < tls1_3 < no_max
</CENTER>

<P>
For example, if you want to disable ssl3, all you have to do is to set the minimum 
version to tls1, or any higher protocol. 

<P>The name of the parameters used to configure this option is the same as the 
parameters that are added to the definition of a server to make it a secure 
connection, and they are listed above for your reference.

<P>
The special values &quot;no_min&quot; and &quot;no_max&quot; do not set values
for the minimum and maximum protocol versions, and Alpine will use the maximum
and minimum values of encryption protocols built into your SSL library.

</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_dead-letter-files"--></H1>


This option affects Alpine's behavior when you cancel a message being
composed.  Alpine's usual behavior is to write the canceled message to
a file named 
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
&quot;DEADLETR&quot;,
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;dead.letter&quot; in your home directory,
<!--chtml endif-->
overwriting any previous message.
<P>
If you set this option to a value higher than one, then that many copies
of dead letter files will be saved.
For example, if you set this option to &quot;3&quot; then you may have
files named
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
&quot;DEADLETR&quot;,
&quot;DEADLETR2&quot;, and
&quot;DEADLETR3&quot;.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;dead.letter&quot;,
&quot;dead.letter2&quot;, and
&quot;dead.letter3&quot; in your home directory.
<!--chtml endif-->
In this example, the most recently cancelled message will be in
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
&quot;DEADLETR&quot;,
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;dead.letter&quot;,
<!--chtml endif-->
and the third most recently cancelled message will be in
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
&quot;DEADLETR3&quot;.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;dead.letter3&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
The fourth most recently cancelled message will no longer be saved.

<P>
If you set this option to zero, then NO record of canceled messages is
maintained.
<P>
If the feature
<A HREF="h_config_quell_dead_letter"><!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-dead-letter-on-cancel"--></A>
is set, that overrides whatever you set for this option.
If this option had existed at the time, then the Quell feature would not
have been added, but it is still there for backwards compatibility.
So, in order for this option to have the desired effect, make sure the
Quell feature is turned off.

<TITLE>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_max-remote-connections"--></TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_max-remote-connections"--></H1>

This option affects low-level behavior of Alpine.
The default value for this option is <EM>3</EM>.
If your INBOX is accessed using the IMAP protocol
from an IMAP server, that connection is kept open throughout the
duration of your Alpine session, independent of the value of this option.
The same is true of any 
<A HREF="h_config_permlocked">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_stay-open-folders"-->&quot;</A>
you have defined.
This option controls Alpine's behavior when connecting to remote IMAP folders
other than your INBOX or your <!--#echo var="VAR_stay-open-folders"-->.
It specifies the maximum number of remote IMAP connections (other than
those mentioned above) that Alpine will use for accessing the rest of your
folders.
If you set this option to zero, you will turn off most remote connection
re-use.
It's difficult to understand exactly what this option does, and it is usually
fine to leave it set to its default value.
It is probably more likely that you will be interested in setting the
<A HREF="h_config_permlocked">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_stay-open-folders"-->&quot;</A> option
instead of changing the value of this option.
A slightly longer explanation of what is going on with this option
is given in the next paragraphs.

<P>
There are some time costs involved in opening and closing remote IMAP 
folders, the main costs being the time you have to wait for the connection
to the server and the time for the folder to open.
Opening a folder may involve not only the time the server takes to do its
processing but time that Alpine uses to do filtering.
These times can vary widely.
They depend on how loaded the server is, how large
the folder being opened is, and how you set up filtering, among other things.
Once Alpine has opened a connection to a particular folder, it will attempt
to keep that connection open in case you use it again.
In order to do this,
Alpine will attempt to use the <!--#echo var="VAR_max-remote-connections"--> (the value of
this option) IMAP connections you have alloted for this purpose.
<P>
For example, suppose the value of this option is set to &quot;2&quot;.
If your INBOX is accessed on a remote server using the IMAP protocol, that
doesn't count as one of the remote connections but it is always kept open.
If you then open another IMAP folder, that would be your first
remote connection counted as one of the <!--#echo var="VAR_max-remote-connections"--> connections.
If you open a third folder the second will be left open, in case you
return to it.
You won't be able to tell it has been left open.
It will appear to be closed when you leave the folder but the connection
will remain in the background.
Now suppose you go back to the second folder (the first folder after the
INBOX).
A connection to that folder is still open so you won't have to wait
for the startup time to open it.
Meanwhile, the connection to the third folder will be left behind.
Now, if you open a fourth folder, you will bump into the
<!--#echo var="VAR_max-remote-connections"--> limit, because this will be the third folder other
than INBOX and you have the option set to &quot;2&quot;.
The connection that is being used for
the third folder will be re-used for this new fourth folder.
If you go back to the third folder after this, it is no longer already
connected when you get there.
You'll still save some time since Alpine will re-use the connection to the
fourth folder and you have already logged in on that connection,
but the folder will have to be re-opened from scratch.
<P>
If a folder is large and the startup cost is dominated by the time it takes
to open that folder or to run filters on it, then it will pay to make the
value of this option large enough to keep it open.
On the other hand, if you only revisit a handful of folders or if
the folders are small, then it might
make more sense to keep this number small so that the reconnect
time (the time to start up a new connection and authenticate)
is eliminated instead.
<P>
You may also need to consider the impact on the server.
On the surface, a larger number here may cause a larger impact on the
server, since you will have more connections open to the server.
On the other hand, not only will <EM>you</EM> be avoiding the startup costs
associated with reopening a folder, but the <EM>server</EM> will be
avoiding those costs as well.
<P>
When twenty five minutes pass without any active use of an IMAP connection
being saved for possible re-use, that connection will be shut down,

<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_stay-open-folders"--></H1>

This option affects low-level behavior of Alpine.
There is no default value for this option.
It is related to the options

<A HREF="h_config_maxremstream">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_max-remote-connections"-->&quot;</A>,

<P>
Note: changes made to this list take effect the next time you open a
folder in the list.

<P>
This is a list of folders that will be permanently kept open once they
are first opened.
The names in this list may be either the nickname of an Incoming folder
or the full technical specification of a folder.
The folders in this list need not be remote IMAP folders, they could usefully
be local folders, as well.
If a folder in the list is a newsgroup or is not accessed either locally
or via IMAP, then the entry will be ignored.
For example, folders accessed via NNTP or POP3 will not be kept open, since
the way that new mail is found with those protocols involves closing and
reopening the connection.
<P>
Once a Stay Open folder has been opened, new-mail checking will continue
to happen on that folder for the rest of the Alpine session.
Your INBOX is always implicitly included in this Stay-Open list and doesn't
need to be added explicitly.
<P>
Another difference that you may notice between a Stay Open folder and a
non-Stay Open folder is which message is selected as the current message
when you enter the folder index.
Normally, the starting position for an incoming folder (which most Stay Open
folders will likely be) is controlled by the
<A HREF="h_config_inc_startup"><!--#echo var="VAR_incoming-startup-rule"--></A>.
However, if a folder is a Stay Open folder, when you re-enter the folder
after the first time the current message will be the same as it was when
you left the folder.
An exception is made if you use the TAB command to get to the folder.
In that case, the message number will be incremented by one from what it
was when you left the folder.
<P>
The above special behavior is thought to be useful.
However, it is special and different from what you might at first expect.
The feature
<A HREF="h_config_use_reg_start_for_stayopen"><!--#echo var="FEAT_use-regular-startup-rule-for-stayopen-folders"--></A>
may be used to turn off this special treatment.
<P>
If the message that was current when you left the folder no longer exists,
then the regular startup rule will be used instead.

This option controls when Alpine's line-by-line scrolling occurs.
Typically, when a selected item is at the top or bottom screen edge
and the UP or DOWN (and Ctrl-P or Ctrl-N) keys are struck, the
displayed items are scrolled down or up by a single line.

<P>
This option allows you to tell Alpine the number of lines from the top and
bottom screen edge that line-by-line paging should occcur.  For example,
setting this value to one (1) will cause Alpine to scroll the display
vertically when you move to select an item on the display's top or
bottom edge.

<P>
By default, this variable is zero, indicating that scrolling happens
when you move up or down to select an item immediately off the display's
top or bottom edge.

This option affects how a &quot;word&quot; is defined in the composer.
The definition of a word is used when using the Forward Word and Backward
Word commands in the composer, as well as when using the spell checker.
Whitespace is always considered a word separator.
Punctuation (like question marks, periods, commas, and so on) is always
a word separator if it comes at the end of a word.
By default, a punctuation character that is in the middle of a word does
not break up that word as long as the character before and the character
after it are both alphanumeric.
If you add a character to this option it will be considered a
word separator even when it occurs in the middle of an alphanumeric word.
For example, if you want to skip through each part of an address instead
of skipping the whole address at once you might want to include &quot;@&quot;
and &quot;.&quot; in this list.
If you want the word-skipper to stop on each part of a UNIX filename you
could add &quot;/&quot; to the list.

<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"--></H1>

This option specifies an aspect of Alpine's Reply command.
When a message is replied to and the text of the message is included, the
included text usually has the string &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&quot; prepended
to each line indicating it is quoted text.
(In case you haven't seen this before, &quot;string&quot; is a technical term
that means chunk of text.)

<P>
Because of the introduction of <A HREF="h_config_quell_flowed_text">Flowed Text</A>
in 1999 and its wide-spread adoption since then, you will usually be better off if you
use one of the standard values,
&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot;, for this option.

<P>
This option specifies a different value for that string.
If you wish to use a string that begins or ends with a space,
enclose the string in double quotes.

<P>
Besides simple text, the prepended string can be based
on the message being replied to.
The following tokens are substituted for the message's corresponding value:

<DL>
<DT>_FROM_</DT>
<DD>This token gets replaced with the message sender's &quot;username&quot;.
If the name is longer than six characters, only the first six characters are
used.
</DD>

<DT>_NICK_</DT>
<DD>This token gets replaced with the nickname of the message sender's
address as found in your addressbook.
If no addressbook entry is found,
Alpine replaces the characters &quot;_NICK_&quot; with nothing.
If the nickname is longer than six characters, only the first six characters are
used.
</DD>

<DT>_INIT_</DT>
<DD>This token gets replaced with the initials of the sender of the message.
</DD>

</DL>

NOTE: When the
<A HREF="h_config_prefix_editing">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-reply-indent-string-editing"-->&quot;</A>

it is the default or one automatically generated using the above tokens.
<P>
If you change your <!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"-->
so that it is not equal to the default value of &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&quot;, then
quoted text will not be flowed

For this reason, we recommend that you leave your <!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"-->

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_quote-replace-string"--></H1>

This option specifies what string to use as a quote when <b>viewing</b> a
message.  The standard way of quoting messages when replying is the string
&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&quot; (quote space).
With this variable set, viewing a message will
replace occurrences of 
&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; with the replacement string.
This setting works best when
<A HREF="h_config_reply_indent_string"><!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"--></A>
or the equivalent setting in your correspondents' mail programs
is set to the default
&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&quot;, but it will also work fine with the
<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"--> set to &quot;&gt;&quot;.
<P>
By default, this setting will only work on messages that are flowed, which is
the default way of sending messages for many mail clients including
Alpine.  Enable the feature
<A HREF="h_config_quote_replace_noflow"><!--#echo var="FEAT_quote-replace-nonflowed"--></A>
to also have quote-replacement performed on non-flowed messages.
<P>

Setting this option will replace  &quot;&gt;&quot; and 
&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&quot; with the new setting. This string may include trailing
spaces. To preserve those spaces enclose the full string in double quotes.
<P>
No padding to separate the text of the message from the quote string is
added. This means that if you do not add trailing spaces to the value of
this variable, text will be displayed right next to the quote string,
which may be undesirable. This can be avoided by adding a new string
separated by a space from your selection of quote string replacement. This
last string will be used for padding. For example, setting this variable to 
<br>&quot;&gt;&quot; &quot; &quot; has the effect of setting
&quot;&gt;&quot; as the <!--#echo var="VAR_quote-replace-string"-->, with the text padded by
a space from the last quote string to make it more readable.
<P>
One possible setting for this variable could be
&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; (four spaces wrapped in quotes), which
would have the effect of indenting each level of quoting four spaces and
removing the &quot;&gt;&quot;'s.  Different levels of quoting could be made
more discernible by setting colors for quoted text.
<P>
Replying to or forwarding the viewed message will preserve the original
formatting of the message, so quote-replacement will not be performed on
messages that are being composed.

</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_status-message-delay"--></H1>

This option has evolved over time, causing the possible values to be
counter-intuitive.
Read carefully before you set this option.
First we explain what the option does, then there is a longer discussion
following that.
<P>
If this is set to zero, the default value, it has <EM>no</EM> effect.
Positive and negative values serve two similar, but different purposes.
<P>
If it is set to a positive number, it causes the cursor to move to the
status line whenever a status message is printed and pause there for this
many seconds.
It will probably only be useful if the 
<A HREF="h_config_show_cursor">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_show-cursor"-->&quot;</A> feature is
also turned on.
Setting this option to a positive number can only be used to
<EM>increase</EM> the status message delay.
This may be useful for Braille displays, or other non-traditional displays.
<P>
If it is set to a negative number the interpretation is a bit complicated.
Negative numbers are used to <EM>decrease</EM> the amount of delay Alpine uses to
allow you to read important status messages.
Of course, this may cause you to miss some important messages.
If you see a message flash by but miss what it says you can use the
Journal command from the MAIN MENU to read it.
If you set this option to a negative value, the delay will be
no more than one second less than the absolute value
of the value you set.
So if you set it to -1, the delay will be no more than zero seconds, no
delay at all.
If you set it to -2, the delay will be no more than 1 second.
And so on, -3 is 2 seconds, -4 is 3 seconds, ...
If the delay that Alpine would have used by default is less than this delay,
then the smaller delay set by Alpine will be used.
Setting this option to a negative value can only reduce the amount of
delay, never increase it.
<P>
Here is a more detailed explanation.
Status messages are the messages that show up spontaneously in the
status message line, usually the third line from the bottom of the screen.
By default, Alpine assigns each status message it produces a minimum
display time.
Some status messages have a minimum display time of zero.
You can see an example of such a message by paging up in this help text
until you reach the top of the screen.
If you try to page past the top you will see the message
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[Already at start of help text]</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
in the status line.
If there is another more important use of the status message line this message
might be replaced quickly, or it even might not be shown at all.
However, if there is no reason to get rid of the message, it might stay
there for several seconds while you read the help.
An example where it is replaced immediately happens when you page up in
the help text past the top of the screen, but then type the &quot;WhereIs&quot;
command right after paging up.
The message will disappear immediately without causing a delay (unless you
have set this option to a positive value) to allow you to type input for
the &quot;WhereIs&quot; command.
Since it isn't a very important message, Alpine has set its minimum display
time to zero seconds.
<P>
Other messages have minimum display times of three or more seconds.
These are usually error messages that Alpine thinks you ought to see.
For example, it might be a message about a failed Save or a failed folder open.
It is often the case that this minimum display time won't delay you in
any way because the status message line is not needed for another reason.
However, there are times when Alpine has to delay what it is doing in
order to display a status message for the minimum display time.
This happens when a message is being displayed and Alpine wants to ask
for input from the keyboard.
For example, when you Save a message you use the status message line.
You get a prompt there asking for the name of the folder to save to.
If there is a status message being displayed that has not
yet displayed for its minimum
time Alpine will display that status message surrounded with the characters
&gt; and &lt; to show you that it is delaying.
That might happen, for example, if you tried to save to a folder that
caused an error, then followed that immediately with another Save command.
You might find yourself waiting for a status message like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[&gt;Can't get write access to mailbox, access is readonly&lt;]</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
to finish displaying for three seconds.
If that is something you find happening to you frequently, you may use
negative values of this option to decrease or eliminate that delay, at
the risk of missing the message.

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: NewMail FIFO Path</H1>

This option is only available in UNIX Alpine.
However, there is a very similar feature built in to PC-Alpine.
In PC-Alpine's Config menu at the top of the screen
is an option called &quot;New Mail Window&quot;.
<P>
You may have Alpine create a FIFO special file (also called a named pipe) where
it will send a one-line message each time a new message is received in
the current folder, the INBOX, or any open
<A HREF="h_config_permlocked"><!--#echo var="VAR_stay-open-folders"--></A>.
To protect against two different Alpines both writing to the same FIFO, Alpine
will only create the FIFO and write to it if it doesn't already exist.
<P>
A possible way to use this option would be to have a separate window
on your screen running the command
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>cat filename</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;filename&quot; is the name of the file given for this option.
Because the file won't exist until after you start Alpine, you must <EM>first</EM>
start Alpine and <EM>then</EM> run the &quot;cat&quot; command.
You may be tempted to use &quot;tail -f filename&quot; to view the new
mail log.
However, the common implementations of the tail command will not do what you
are hoping.
<P>
The width of the messages produced for the FIFO may be altered with the
<A HREF="h_config_newmailwidth"><!--#echo var="VAR_newmail-window-width"--></A> option.
<P>
On some systems, fifos may only be created in a local filesystem.
In other words, they may not be in NFS filesystems.
This requirement is not universal.
If the system you are using supports it, it should work.
(It is often the case that your home directory is in an NFS filesystem.
If that is the case, you might try using a file in the &quot;/tmp&quot;
filesystem, which is usually a local filesytem.)
Even when it is possible to use an NFS-mounted filesystem as a place to name
the fifo (for example, your home directory), it will still be the case that
the reader (probably the &quot;cat&quot; command) and the
writer (Alpine) of the fifo must be running on the same system.

<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_mail-check-interval"--></H1>

This option specifies, in seconds,
how often Alpine will check for new mail.
If set to zero, new-mail checking is disabled.
(You can always manually force a new-mail check by typing ^L (Ctrl-L), which is also the command to refresh the screen, or by typing the Next command when the
current message is the last message of the folder.)
There is a minimum value for this option, normally 15 seconds.
The default value is normally 150 seconds.
The higher you set this option, the easier it is on the server.
<P>
There are some situations where automatic new-mail checking does not work.
See the discussion about new-mail checking in
<A HREF="h_config_reopen_rule">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_folder-reopen-rule"-->&quot;</A>.
<P>
The new-mail checking will not happen exactly at the frequency that you specify.
For example, Alpine may elect to defer a non-INBOX mail check if you
are busy typing.
Or, it may check more frequently than you have specified if that is
thought to be necessary to keep the server from closing the connection
to the folder due to inactivity.
If Alpine checks for new mail as a side effect of another command, it will reset
the timer, so that new-mail checking may seem to happen irregularly instead of
every X seconds like clockwork.
<P>
If you are anxious to know about new mail as soon as possible, set the check
interval low, and you'll know about the new mail by approximately
that amount of time after it arrives.
If you aren't so worried about knowing right away, set this option to a
higher value.
That will save the server some processing time and may save you some of
the time you spend waiting for new-mail checks to happen if you are
dealing with a slow server or slow network connection.
<P>
If you suspect that new-mail checking is causing slow downs for you,
you may want to look into the options
<A HREF="h_config_quell_checks_comp">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-mailchecks-composing-except-inbox"-->&quot;</A>,
<A HREF="h_config_quell_checks_comp_inbox">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-mailchecks-composing-inbox"-->&quot;</A> and
<A HREF="h_config_mailchecknoncurr">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_mail-check-interval-noncurrent"-->&quot;</A>,
which refine when mail checking is done.
<P>
If the mailbox being checked uses a <A HREF="h_maildrop">Mail Drop</A> then
there is a minimum time
(<A HREF="h_config_maildropcheck">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_maildrop-check-minimum"-->&quot;</A>)
between new-mail checks.
Because of this minimum you may notice that new mail does not
appear promptly when you expect it.
The reason for this is to protect the server from over-zealous opening and
closing of the Mail Drop folder, since that is a costly operation.

If this option is set, then the normal new-mail checking that happens

INBOX (which depends on the setting
of &quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-mailchecks-composing-inbox"-->&quot;).
<P>
You might want to set this option if you are experiencing delays while
composing that you think might be related to the speed of the new-mail
checks.
<P>
Even with this option turned on, an occasional new-mail check may be done
in order to keep the server from killing the connection to the folder.
For example, IMAP servers may remove a connection to a folder if there
has been no activity on the connection for 30 minutes or more.
Instead of letting that happen, Alpine will check for new mail before the
30 minutes is up even though you have turned on this feature to quell
those checks.
<P>
Besides new-mail checks, checkpoint operations on the folders
will also be quelled when you set this option.
The purpose of checkpointing is to write the changes to a folder out to
disk periodically in order to avoid losing those changes when system or
software problems occur.
New-mail checking and checkpointing while you are not composing are not
affected by this option.

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_maildrop-check-minimum"--></H1>

New-mail checking for a
<A HREF="h_maildrop">Mail Drop</A> is a little different from new
mail checking for a regular folder.
One of the differences is that the connection to the Mail Drop is not
kept open and so the cost of checking
(delay for you and additional load for the server) may be significant.
Because of this additional cost we set a minimum time that
must pass between checks.
This minimum only applies to the automatic checking done by Alpine.
If you force a check by typing ^L (Ctrl-L) or by typing the Next command when you are
at the end of a folder index, then the check is done right away.
<P>
This option specifies, in seconds, the <EM>minimum</EM> time between Mail Drop
new-mail checks.
You may want to set this minimum high in order to avoid experiencing some
of the delays associated with the checks.
Note that the time between checks is still controlled by the regular
<A HREF="h_config_mailcheck"><!--#echo var="VAR_mail-check-interval"--></A> option.
When Alpine is about to do an automatic check for new mail (because
the <!--#echo var="VAR_mail-check-interval"--> has expired) then if the time since the last
new-mail check
of any open Mail Drops has been greater than the <!--#echo var="VAR_maildrop-check-minimum"-->,
the Mail Drop is checked for new mail as well.
Therefore, it is only useful to set this option to a value that is higher
than the <!--#echo var="VAR_mail-check-interval"-->.
<P>
If this option is set to zero, automatic Mail Drop new-mail
checking is disabled.
There is a minimum value, normally 60 seconds.
The default value is normally 60 seconds as well.
This applies to the INBOX and to the currently open folder if that is
different from the INBOX.

<HEADER>

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_nntp-range"--></H1>

This option applies only to newsgroups accessed using the NNTP protocol.
It does not, for example,
apply to newsgroups accessed using an IMAP-to-NNTP proxy.

<P>
When you open a connection to a News server using the NNTP protocol, you
normally have access to all of the articles in each newsgroup.
If a server keeps a large backlog of messages it may speed performance
some to restrict attention to only the newer messages in a group.
This option allows you to set how many article numbers should be checked
when opening a newsgroup.
You can think of &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_nntp-range"-->&quot; as specifying the maximum number
of messages you ever want to see.
For example, if you only ever wanted to look at the last 500 messages in each
newsgroup you could set this option to 500.
In actuality, it isn't quite that.
Instead, for performance reasons, it specifies the range of article
numbers to be checked, beginning
with the highest numbered article and going backwards from there.
If there are messages that have been canceled or deleted
their article numbers are still counted as part of the range.
<P>
So, more precisely, setting the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_nntp-range"-->&quot; will cause article
numbers
<P><CENTER>last_article_number - <!--#echo var="VAR_nntp-range"--> + 1 through last_article_number</CENTER>
<P>
to be considered when reading a newsgroup.
The number of messages that show up in your index will be less than or equal
to the value of &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_nntp-range"-->&quot;.

<P>
The purpose of this option is simply to speed up access when reading news.
The speedup comes because Alpine can ignore all but the last <!--#echo var="VAR_nntp-range"--> article
numbers, and can avoid downloading any information about the ignored articles.
There is a cost you pay for this speedup.
That cost is that there is no way for you to see those ignored articles.
The articles that come before the range you specify are invisible to you and
to Alpine, as if they did not exist at all.
There is no way to see those messages using, for example, an unexclude command
or something similar.
The only way to see those articles is to set this option high enough (or
set it to zero) and then to reopen the newsgroup.

<P>
If this option is set to 0 (which is also the default),
then the range is unlimited.
This option applies globally to all NNTP servers and to all newsgroups
on those servers.
There is no way to set different values for different newsgroups or servers.

default.  If the current folder is other than &quot;Inbox&quot;,
&quot;Inbox&quot; is offered as the default.

<P>
The available options include:

<DL>

 <DT>folder-in-first-collection</DT>

 <DD> Alpine will offer the most recently visited folder in the default
collection found in the &quot;Collection List&quot; screen as the default.
</DD>
 
 <DT> inbox-or-folder-in-first-collection</DT>

 <DD> If the current folder is &quot;Inbox&quot;,

If the current folder is other than &quot;Inbox&quot;,
&quot;Inbox&quot; is offered as the default.

 <DD> This is Alpine's default behavior.
If the current folder is &quot;Inbox&quot;,
Alpine will offer the last open
folder as the default.
If the current folder is other than &quot;Inbox&quot;,
&quot;Inbox&quot; is offered as the default.
</DD>
 
 <DT> first-collection-with-inbox-default</DT>

 <DD> Instead of offering the most recently visited folder in the default
collection, the default collection is offered but with &quot;Inbox&quot; as
the default folder.
If you type in a folder name it will be in the default collection.
If you simply accept the default, however, your &quot;Inbox&quot; will be opened.
</DD>

 <DT> most-recent-folder</DT>

 <DD> The last accepted value simply causes the most recently opened
folder to be offered as the default regardless of the currently opened
folder.

By default, Alpine will ask at the beginning of each month whether or not
you want to rename your sent-mail folder to a name like sent-mail-month-year.
(See the feature <A HREF="h_config_prune_uses_iso"><!--#echo var="FEAT_prune-uses-yyyy-mm"--></A> to
change the format of the folder to sent-mail-yyyy-mm.)
It will also ask whether you would like to delete old sent-mail folders.
If you have defined
<A HREF="h_config_read_message_folder"><!--#echo var="VAR_read-message-folder"--></A>
or
<A HREF="h_config_pruned_folders"><!--#echo var="VAR_pruned-folders"--></A>
Alpine will also ask about pruning those folders.
<P>

With this option you may provide an automatic answer to these questions.
The default value is to ask you what you'd like to do.
<P>

The six possible values for this option are:

<DL>
<DT>ask about rename, ask about deleting</DT>
<DD>This is the default.
Alpine will ask whether you want to rename the folders and whether you
want to delete each of the old folders.
</DD>

<DT>ask about rename, don't delete</DT>
<DD>Alpine will ask whether you want to rename the folders, but won't
ask about or delete old folders.
</DD>

<DT>always rename, ask about deleting</DT>
<DD>This means you want to always answer yes and have Alpine automatically
rename the folder if possible.
You will also be asked about deleting old folders.
</DD>

<DT>always rename, don't delete</DT>
<DD>This means you want to always answer yes and have Alpine automatically
rename the folder if possible.
There will be no deleting of old folders.
</DD>

<DT>don't rename, ask about deleting</DT>
<DD>This means you want to always answer no.
Alpine will not rename the folder.
You will be asked about deleting old folders.

====== h_config_reopen_rule =====
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_folder-reopen-rule"--></TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_folder-reopen-rule"--></H1>

Alpine normally checks for new mail in the currently open folder
and in the INBOX every few <A HREF="h_config_mailcheck">minutes</A>.

<P>
There are some situations where automatic new-mail checking does not work.
For example, if a mail folder is opened using the POP protocol or a newsgroup
is being read using the NNTP protocol, then new-mail checking is disabled.

<P>
It may be possible to check for new mail in these cases by reopening the
folder.
Alpine does not do this for you automatically, but you may do the commands
manually to cause this to happen.
You reopen by going back to the folder list screen from the message
index screen with the &quot;&lt;&quot; command,
and then going back into the message index screen with
the &quot;&gt;&quot; command.
(Actually, any method you would normally use to open a folder will work the
same as the &quot;&lt;&quot; followed by &quot;&gt;&quot; method.
For example, the GoTo Folder command will work, or you may use L to go to the
Folder List screen and Carriage Return to reopen the folder.)

<P>
There are some cases where Alpine knows that reopening the folder should
be useful as a way to discover new mail.
At the time of this writing, connections made using the POP protocol,
news reading using the NNTP protocol, local news reading, and local
ReadOnly folders that are in the traditional UNIX or the MMDF format all
fall into this category.
There are other cases where it <EM>may</EM> be a way to discover new mail, but Alpine
has no way of knowing, so it might also just be an exercise in futility.
All remote, ReadOnly folders other than those listed just above fall into this
category.
The setting of this option together with the type of folder
controls how Alpine will react to the apparent attempt to reopen a folder.

<P>
If you don't reopen, then you will just be back in
the message index with no change.
You left the index and came back, but the folder remained &quot;open&quot;
the whole time.
However, if you do reopen the folder, the folder is closed and then reopened.
In this case, the current state of the open folder is lost.
The New status, Important and Answered flags,
selected state, Zoom state, collapsed or expanded state of threads,
current message number,
and any other temporary state is all lost when the reopen happens.
For POP folders (but not NNTP newsgroups) the Deleted flags are also lost.

<P>
In the possibilities listed below, the text says &quot;POP/NNTP&quot; in
several places.
That really implies the case where Alpine knows it is a good way to discover
new mail, which is more than just POP and NNTP, but POP and NNTP are
the cases of most interest.
This option probably has more possible values than it deserves. They are:

<DL>
<DT>Always reopen</DT>
<DD>Alpine will not ask whether you want to reopen but will just do the reopen
whenever you type a command that implies a reopen, regardless of the
access method.
In other words, it is assumed you would always answer Yes if asked
about reopening.
</DD>

<DT>Yes for POP/NNTP, Ask about other remote [Yes]</DT>
<DD>Alpine will assume a Yes answer if the access method is POP or NNTP, but
will ask you whether to reopen other remote folders,
with a default answer of Yes.
</DD>

<DT>Yes for POP/NNTP, Ask about other remote [No]</DT>
<DD>Alpine will assume a Yes answer if the access method is POP or NNTP, but
will ask you whether to reopen other remote folders,
with a default answer of No.
</DD>

<DT>Yes for POP/NNTP, No for other remote</DT>
<DD>Alpine will assume a Yes answer if the access method is POP or NNTP, and
will assume a No answer for all other remote folders.
</DD>

<DT>Always ask [Yes]</DT>
<DD>Alpine will not differentiate based on access method.
It will always ask for all remote folders, with a default answer of Yes.
</DD>

<DT>Always ask [No]</DT>
<DD>Alpine will not differentiate based on access method.
It will always ask for all remote folders, with a default answer of No.
</DD>

<DT>Ask about POP/NNTP [Yes], No for other remote</DT>
<DD>Alpine will ask if the access method is POP or NNTP, with a default answer
of Yes.
It will never attempt to reopen other remote folders.
</DD>

<DT>Ask about POP/NNTP [No], No for other remote</DT>
<DD>This is the default.
Alpine will ask if the access method is POP or NNTP, with a default answer
of No.
It will never attempt to reopen other remote folders.
</DD>

<DT>Never reopen</DT>
<DD>Alpine will never attempt to reopen already open folders.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Remember, wherever it says POP or NNTP above it really means POP or NNTP or
any of the other situations where it is likely that reopening is a good way
to discover new mail.

<P>
There is an alternative that may be of useful in some situations.
Instead of manually checking for new mail you can set up a
<A HREF="h_maildrop">Mail Drop</A>
and automatically check for new mail.

<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_incoming-startup-rule"--></H1>

This value affects Alpine's behavior when opening the &quot;INBOX&quot; or 
one of the &quot;INCOMING MESSAGE FOLDERS&quot;.
It determines which message will be the <EM>current message</EM> when
the folder is first opened.
The default value is &quot;first-unseen&quot;.

<P>
The seven possible values for this option are:

<DL>
<DT>first-unseen</DT>
<DD>The current message is set to the first
unseen message that has not been marked deleted, or the last message if
all of the messages have been seen previously.
Messages which have not been seen or which have been seen but re-marked
as New are considered unseen messages.
See the note at the bottom of this help about newsgroups.
</DD>

<DT>first-recent</DT>
<DD>Similar to the default, but rather than starting on the first
unseen message Alpine starts on the first <EM>recent</EM> message.
A message is recent if it arrived since the last time the folder was
open.  This value causes the current message to be set to the first
recent message if there is one, otherwise to the last
message in the folder.
</DD>

<DT>first-important</DT>
<DD>This will result in the current message being set to the first
message marked Important (but not Deleted).
If no messages are marked Important, then it will be the last message.
Messages are marked Important by <EM>you</EM>, not by the sender, using
the
<A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag command</A>.
Or they may be marked Important by an Alpine
<A HREF="h_mainhelp_filtering">Filter</A>
that you have set up.
</DD>

<DT>first-important-or-unseen</DT>
<DD>This selects the first of the first unseen and the first important
messages.
</DD>

<DT>first-important-or-recent</DT>
<DD>This selects the first of the first recent and the first important
messages.
</DD>

<DT>first</DT>
<DD>Simply starts you on the <EM>first</EM> undeleted message in the folder.
If all messages are deleted you start on the last message.
</DD>

<DT>last</DT>
<DD>Simply starts you on the <EM>last</EM> undeleted message in the folder
If all messages are deleted you start on the last message.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
NOTE:  For newsgroups in the incoming collection, &quot;first-unseen&quot; and
&quot;first-recent&quot; are the same and are affected by whether or not the
feature 
<A HREF="h_config_news_uses_recent">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_news-approximates-new-status"-->&quot;</A>
is turned on. 
Also, there is no permanent storage in news for an Important flag.
This means that no messages will be marked Important when a newsgroup is
first opened.

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_url-viewers"--></H1>
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
PC-Alpine users do not need to enter anything here, unless:<UL>
<LI> they want to override, for use with Alpine, the application defined
in the Windows operating system for handling URLs; or
<LI> they are (planning on) using the same configuration file with 
Unix Alpine.
</UL>
<P>
Note that if using a viewer that has a space in its path, you should
use the DOS name for that directory or file. Example:
<PRE>
url-viewer=C:&#92;Progra~1&#92;mozilla&#92;mozilla.exe
</PRE>
<HR><P>
<!--chtml endif-->
This option affects Alpine's handling of URLs that are found in 
messages you read.  Normally, only URLs Alpine can handle directly
are automatically offered for selection in the &quot;Message
Text&quot; screen.  When one or more applications
capable of deciphering URLs on their command line are added here, Alpine
will choose the first available to display URLs it cannot handle directly.
A viewer's availability is based on its being specified with a <B>full
directory path</B> and the evaluation of any optionally supplied
parameters described below.

<P>
Additionally, to support various connection methods and applications, each
entry in this list can optionally begin with one or more of
the following special tokens.  The allowed tokens include:

<P>
<DL>
<DT>_TEST(<VAR>test-string</VAR>)_</DT>
<DD>
The <VAR>test-string</VAR> is a shell command that Alpine will run to
evaluate a viewer's availability.  The command specified by the test
string is run and if its resulting exit status is non-zero, Alpine will
not consider the associated viewer for use.
</DD>

<DT>_SCHEME(<VAR>scheme-list</VAR>)_</DT>
<DD>
The <VAR>scheme-list</VAR> is a list of one or more (comma-delimited)
URL schemes that are to be used with the associated viewer.  This is
the way to configure Alpine to recognize URLs other than the built-in set.
<P>
It can also be used to override Alpine's built-in handlers.
For example, you could specify &quot;news&quot; in the <VAR>scheme-list</VAR>,
and Alpine would use (provided it passed all other criteria) the associated
viewer when it encounterd a URL of the form &quot;news:comp.mail.pine&quot;.

</DD>
</DL>

<P>
By default, Alpine will simply append a space character followed by the
selected URL prior to launching the command in your specified SHELL.  You can
optionally specify where in the command the selected URL should appear
by using the &quot;_URL_&quot; token.  All occurrences found in the command
will be replaced with the selected URL before the command is handed
to the shell.  If such replacement occurs, the default appending of the
selected URL does not take place.

<P>
NOTE: If the viewer you specify has any command-line arguments,
including the &quot;_URL_&quot; token, you will need to add a
double-quote character before the command path and after the last
argument (see the &quot;lynx&quot; example below).

<P>
So, here are some example entries:
<PRE>
url-viewers = _TEST(&quot;test -n '$&#123;DISPLAY}'&quot;)_  /usr/local/bin/netscape
              &quot;/usr/local/bin/lynx _URL_&quot;
              C:&#92;BIN&#92;NETSCAPE.BAT
</PRE>
<P>
This example shows that for the first viewer in the list to be used
the environment variable &quot;DISPLAY&quot; must be defined.  If it
is, then the path and file &quot;/usr/local/bin/netscape&quot; must exist.  
If neither condition is met,
then the path and file &quot;/usr/local/bin/lynx&quot; must exist.  
If it does, then the &quot;_URL_&quot; token is replaced by the selected URL. 
If the path to &quot;lynx&quot; is invalid,
then the final path and file C:&#92;BIN&#92;NETSCAPE.BAT must exist.  
Note that the last
entry is a DOS/Windows path.  This is one way to support Alpine running
on more than one architecture with the same configuration file.<P>
<P>
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->

Note that depending on the type of browser used and the method of 
its invocation (such as whether it will open in a separate window) from
the MESSAGE TEXT screen, the browser may &quot;supplant&quot; 
the MESSAGE TEXT screen, and you will have to quit the browser to return to 
it (for example, when using Lynx; to exit Lynx, use the &quot;Q&quot; command).
In other words, launching the browser from Alpine may make Alpine 
&quot;disappear&quot; (although it is still &quot;running&quot;)
until you close the browser again.<P>

<BODY>
<H1>Defining <!--#echo var="VAR_url-viewers"--> in an X windows 
environment: for advanced users and  systems administrators</H1>
If you are using Alpine with an X-terminal (emulator) and want to define an 
X windows-based application in <!--#echo var="VAR_url-viewers"-->, 
you may want to do so in a manner that causes any <B>already</B> 
invoked viewer application to be used for viewing URLs you select from Alpine 
messages, and a <B>new</B> URL-viewer process to be 
started <B>only</B> if the same application has <B>not already</B> 
been launched -- for one reason, to avoid file-locking contentions among 
multiple invocations of the same URL-viewer application.  
(The example entries set in the help screen for the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_url-viewers"-->&quot; 
option does not do this.)  A method of doing that would be:<OL>
<LI> use 
the _TEST(<VAR>test-string</VAR>)_ token in the <B>first</B> entry to 
check (using commands appropriate for your Unix shell
in place of <VAR>test-string</VAR>) for the presence of a 
lockfile created by the URL-viewer application -- which implies that the 
application is already running, though this is not foolproof. 
Following that in the same <!--#echo var="VAR_url-viewers"--> entry, specify the 
application with its appropriate command line option(s) to 
show the URL selected from the Alpine message in an already open window of 
that application, or perhaps in a new window of that application.  

<LI> In the 
<B>second</B> entry for the <!--#echo var="VAR_url-viewers"--> option, specify the same 
application without those command line options, but this time using the 
_TEST(...)_ token to check whether the environment variable &quot;DISPLAY&quot;
is defined.
<LI> If you will be using Alpine (with the same .pinerc file) outside of the X 
windows environment (for instance, using VT-100 terminal emulation), you 
may wish to specify a non-X windows URL-viewer application such as Lynx
as the last entry.
</OL><BR>
How exactly you define your <!--#echo var="VAR_url-viewers"--> entries to do this will depend on 
the command shell, the URL-viewer application(s), and possibly the specific 
version of the latter, you are using.  
<P>
Relevant command 
line options for the Netscape browser for showing URLs (selected from Alpine) 
when Netscape is already running are discussed in the document

This feature enables the &quot;H Full Headers&quot; command which toggles between
the display of all headers in the message and the normal edited view of
headers.  The Full Header command also controls which headers are included
for Export, Pipe, Print, Forward, and Reply functions.  (For Reply, the
Full Header mode will respect the
<A HREF="h_config_include_header">&quot;Include-Headers-in-Reply&quot;</A>
feature setting.)
<P>
If Full Header mode is turned on and you Forward a message, you will
be asked if you'd like to forward the message as an attachment, as opposed
to including the text of the message in the body of your new message.
<P>
If you have also turned on the
<A HREF="h_config_quote_suppression">&quot;Quote Suppression&quot;</A>
option then the Full Headers command actually rotates through three states
instead of just two.
The first is the normal view with long quotes suppressed.
The second is the normal view but with the long quotes included.
The last enables the display of all headers in the message.
When using Export, Pipe, Print, Forward, or Reply the quotes are
never suppressed, so the first two states are identical.
<P>
Normally, the Header Mode will reset
to the default behavior when moving to a new message.
The mode can be made to persist from message to message by setting the feature

The <A HREF="h_common_hdrmode">HdrMode Command</A>
normally resets to the default state when switching to a new message.
For example, if you've used the &quot;H&quot; command to turn on Full
Headers for a message you are viewing, and then you type the Next command
to look at the next message, the full headers will no longer be shown.
Setting this feature disables that reset.
Instead, the Header Mode remains the same from message to message.

This feature modifies the behavior of the
<a href="h_common_flag">Flag</a> command
and the <A HREF="h_index_cmd_select">Select</A> command.
This feature is set by default.
When this feature is not set, when the "* Flag" command is selected,
Alpine offers a prompt to set one of several flags and also offers the
option of entering the detailed flag manipulation screen via the "^T"
key.
If you have
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A>
defined, then enabling this feature adds a shortcut way to set or unset
keywords.
You use &quot;*&quot; followed by the first letter of a keyword (or the nickname of
a keyword if you've given it a nickname) and that will set the keyword.
<P>
An example is easier to understand than the explanation.
The flag command can always be used to set the system flags.
For example, to set the Answered flag you would type
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>* A</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Now suppose you have defined a keyword &quot;Work&quot; using the <!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"-->
option in the Config screen.
By default, to set a keyword like &quot;Work&quot; you would usually
have to go to the Flag Details screen using
the &quot;^T To Flag Details&quot; command.
Instead, if you have enabled this feature, you may type
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>* W</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
to set the Work flag, or
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>* ! W</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
to unset it.
Just like for the other flag setting commands, the case of the letter does
not matter, so &quot;w&quot; or &quot;W&quot; both set the &quot;Work&quot;
keyword.
<P>
Notice that you can only use this trick for one keyword that begins
with &quot;W&quot;.
If you happen to have a &quot;Work&quot; keyword and another keyword that is
&quot;WIFI&quot; the &quot;* W&quot; command will set the first one in
your list of keywords.
Also, there are five letters that are reserved for system
flags and the NOT command.
If you type &quot;* A&quot; it will always set the Answered flag, not
your &quot;Aardvark&quot; keyword.
In order to set the &quot;Aardvark&quot; keyword you'll still have to use
the Flag Details screen.
<P>
Because enabling the
<A HREF="h_config_flag_screen_default"><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-flag-screen-implicitly"--></A>
option causes Alpine to skip directly to the Flag Details screen when the
Flag command is used, 
setting it will cause this feature to have no effect at all.
<P>
Similarly, when Selecting by Keyword, setting this option will allow you
to use Keyword initials instead of full keywords.

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs"--></H1>

This feature controls one aspect of the message composer; in particular,
what happens when an unqualified name is entered into an address header.
If set, unqualified names entered as addresses will be treated as errors
unless they match an addressbook nickname.  Alpine will not attempt to turn
them into complete addresses by adding your local domain.<P>

A complete (fully qualified) address is one containing a username followed
by an &quot;@&quot; (&quot;at&quot;) symbol, followed by a domain name (e.g.
&quot;jsmith@example.com&quot;).  An unqualified name is one <B>without</B> 
the &quot;@&quot; symbol and domain name (e.g. &quot;jsmith&quot;). 

(See also <A HREF="h_address_format">Explanation of Address formats</A>.)

<P>

When you enter a fully qualified address, Alpine does not interpret or
modify it, but simply passes it on to the mail-transport-agent (MTA) for
your system.  Alpine conforms to the Internet standards governing message
headers and will not send an unqualifed name to the MTA.  Therefore, when
you enter an unqualified name, Alpine will normally attempt to turn it into
a fully qualified address, first by checking to see if you have entered a
matching nickname in your addressbook, or failing that, by simply adding
your own domain to the name entered.  So if your address is
&quot;jsmith@example.com&quot; and you enter &quot;fred&quot;, then (assuming 
&quot;fred&quot; is not a nickname in your addressbook), Alpine will turn 
that into &quot;fred@example.com&quot;.<P>

There are situations where it is not desirable for Alpine to interpret such
unqualified names as valid (local) addresses.  For example, if &quot;fred&quot;
turned out to be a typo (intended to be an addressbook nickname), but
there actually was a &quot;fred&quot; in your local domain, the message might 
be mis-delivered without your realizing it.  In order to reduce the likelihood
of such accidents, setting this feature will cause Alpine to treat such
addresses as errors, and require that you explicitly enter the full local
address (e.g. &quot;fred@example.com&quot;) or correct the name so that it 
matches an address book nickname.<P>

Consider this a safety feature against mis-directed mail.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file"--></H1>

This feature controls an aspect of Alpine's Composer, and if needed, will
usually be set by your system manager in Alpine's system-wide configuration
file. Specifically, if this feature is set, Alpine will not attempt to look
in the system password file to find a Full Name for the entered address.
<P>
Normally, names you enter into address fields (e.g. To: or Cc:) are
checked against your address book(s) to see if they match an address book
nickname.  Failing that, (in Unix Alpine) the name is then checked against
the Unix password file.  If the entered name matches a username in the
system password file, Alpine extracts the corresponding Full Name information
for that individual, and adds that to the address being entered.
<P>
However, password file matching can have surprising (incorrect) results if
other users of the system do not receive mail at the domain you are using.
That is, if either the 
<A HREF="h_config_user_dom">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_user-domain"-->&quot;</A> or 
<A HREF="h_config_domain_name">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_use-only-domain-name"-->&quot;</A>
option
is set such that the administrative domain of other users on the system
isn't accurately reflected, Alpine should be told that a passwd file match
is coincidental, and Full Name info will be incorrect.  For example, a
personal name from the password file could get falsely paired with the
entered name as it is turned into an address in the configured domain.
<P>
If you are seeing this behavior, enabling this feature will prevent Unix
Alpine from looking up names in the password file to find the Full Name
for incomplete addresses you enter.<P>

The INBOX is normally treated differently from regular folders in several

One of the differences is that the normal &quot;close&quot; sequence of
events is deferred until Alpine is exited, instead of happening when you
leave the INBOX to view another folder.
The &quot;close&quot; sequence normally includes the Expunging
of deleted messages

This feature controls how special control key characters, typically
Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q, are interpreted when input to Alpine.  These characters
are known as the "stop" and "start" characters and are sometimes used in
communications paths to control data flow between devices that operate at
different speeds.

<P>

By default, Alpine turns the system's handling of these special characters
off except during printing.  However, if you see Alpine reporting input errors
such as:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ Command "^Q" not defined for this screen.]
<P>
and, at the same time, see your display become garbled, then it is likely
that setting this option will solve the problem.  Be aware, though, that
enabling this feature will also cause Alpine to ostensibly "hang" 
whenever the Ctrl-S key combination is entered as the system is now
interpreting such input as a "stop output" command.  To "start
output"  again, simply type Ctrl-Q.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-incoming-folders"--></H1>

Alpine's Incoming Message Folders collection
provides a convenient way to access multiple incoming folders.
It is also useful if you have accounts on multiple computers.
<P>

If set, this feature defines a pseudo-folder collection called
&quot;INCOMING MESSAGE FOLDERS&quot;.  Initially, the only folder included
in this collection will be your INBOX, which will no longer show up in
your Default folder collection.
<P>

You may add more folders to the Incoming Message Folders collection by
using the
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
&quot;F10
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;A
<!--chtml endif-->
Add&quot; command in the FOLDER LIST screen.  You will be prompted for
the host the folder is stored on (which defaults to the same host used
for your INBOX), a nickname, and the actual folder name.  Once a set
of Incoming Message Folders are defined, the TAB key (in MESSAGE INDEX
or MESSAGE TEXT screens) may be used to scan the folders for those
with Recent messages.  If you add more folders to
your <!--#echo var="VAR_incoming-folders"--> collection, turning this feature back off will have
no effect.
<P>
NOTE: Normally the software that actually delivers mail (the stuff that happens
before Alpine is involved) is in a better position to do delivery filtering
than is Alpine itself.
If possible, you may want to look at programs such as
&quot;filter&quot; or &quot;procmail&quot;, which are examples of delivery
filtering programs.
If you'd prefer to have Alpine do the filtering for you, you may set that
up.

is displayed, not a set of parentheses with zero inside them.
A redraw command, Ctrl-L, can be used in the FOLDER LIST screen for
the Incoming Message Folders to cause an immediate update.

If a check for Unseen messages fails for a particular folder then Alpine
will no longer attempt to check that folder for the duration of the

More precisely, it is the number of undeleted unseen messages.
Using this option you may display the number of recent messages instead
of the number of unseen messages.
A message is only counted as recent if this is the first session to
see it, so the recent count might be less than the unseen count.
The difference between the two would be accounted for by the unseen messages
in the folder which were there previously but have not been looked at yet.
<P>
If you simultaneously run more than one email client at a time
(for example, you run more than one Alpine in parallel) then turning
this feature on can cause some confusion.
The confusion stems from the fact that each message is only considered to be
recent in one session.
That means that the counts of new messages may be different in the two
Alpines running side by side, because each incoming message will only be
counted as recent in one of the two sessions.
<P>
You may also display the total number of messages

This behavior is particularly useful in case you are replying to a message.
Replying to a message causes the message to be in the same thread than the

this by changing the full subject, by first deleting the original subject and

Normally the Message-ID header that Alpine generates when sending a message
contains the name of the computer from which the message is being sent.
Some believe that this hostname could be used by spammers or could
be used by others for nefarious purposes.
If this feature is set, that name will be transformed with a simple
Rot13 transformation.
The result will still have the correct syntax for a Message-ID but the
part of the MessageID that is often a domain name will not be an actual
domain name because the letters will be scrambled.
<P>
In addition, other information such as the name program, version, and
a code for operating system used to build Alpine, will be encoded using
the Rot13 transformation, except for the version number which will be
encoded using a Rot5 transformation.
<P>
It is possible (but unlikely?) that some spam detection
software will use that as a reason to reject the mail as spam.
It has also been reported that some spam detection software uses the
fact that there are no dots after the &quot;@&quot; as a reason to reject
messages.
If your PC-Alpine Message-ID is using a name without a dot that is because
that is what Windows thinks is your &quot;Full computer name&quot;.
The method used to set this varies from one type of Windows to another but
check under Settings -> Control Panel -> System and
look for Network Identification or Computer Name or something similar.
How to set it is beyond the scope of Alpine.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_downgrade-multipart-to-text"--></H1>

<P>
This feature affects Alpine's behavior when sending mail.  Internet
standards require Alpine to translate all non-ASCII characters in
messages that it sends using MIME encoding.  This encoding can be
ostensibly broken for recipients if any agent between Alpine and the
recipient, such as an email list expander, appends text to the
message, such as list information or advertising.  When sending such
messages Alpine attempts to protect such encoding by placing extra
MIME boundaries around the message text.
<P>
These extra boundaries are invisible to recipients that 
use MIME-aware email programs (the vast majority).  However, if
you correspond with users of email programs that are not MIME-aware,
or do not handle the extra boundaries gracefully, you can
use this feature to prevent Alpine from including the extra
MIME information.  Of course, it will increase the likelihood
that non-ASCII text you send may appear corrupt to the recipient.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_disable-sender"--></H1>

This feature affects Alpine's generation of the &quot;Sender:&quot; or
<A HREF="h_config_use_sender_not_x">&quot;X-X-Sender&quot;</A>
header fields.
By default, Alpine will generate such a header in situations where the
username or domain are not the same as
the &quot;From:&quot; header on the message.
With this feature set,
no &quot;Sender:&quot; or &quot;X-X-Sender&quot; header will be generated.
This may be desirable on a system that is virtually hosting many domains,
and the sysadmin has other methods available for tracking a message to
its originator.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_use-sender-not-x-sender"--></H1>

Normally Alpine adds a header line
labeled &quot;X-X-Sender&quot;, if the sender is
different from the From: line.
The standard specifies that this header
line should be labeled &quot;Sender&quot;, not &quot;X-X-Sender&quot;.
Setting this feature causes
&quot;Sender&quot; to be used instead of &quot;X-X-Sender&quot;.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_compose-cancel-confirm-uses-yes"--></H1>

This feature affects what happens when you type ^C to cancel a composition.
By default, if you attempt to cancel a composition by typing ^C, you will be
asked to confirm the cancellation by typing a &quot;C&quot;
for <EM>C</EM>onfirm.
It logically ought to be a &quot;Y&quot; for <EM>Y</EM>es, but that is
risky because the &quot;^C Y&quot; needed to cancel a message
is close (on the keyboard) to the &quot;^X Y&quot; needed to send a message.
<P>
If this feature is set the confirmation asked for
will be a &quot;<EM>Y</EM>es&quot;
instead of a &quot;<EM>C</EM>onfirm&quot; response.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-background-sending"--></H1>

This feature affects the behavior of Alpine's mail sending.  If set, this
feature enables a subcommand in the composer's "Send?" confirmation
prompt.  The subcommand allows you to tell Alpine to handle the actual
posting in the background.  While this feature usually allows posting
to appear to happen very fast, it has no affect on the actual delivery
time it takes a message to arrive at its destination.

<P>
Please Note:

 <LI>This feature will have no effect if the feature
       <A HREF="h_config_send_wo_confirm">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_send-without-confirm"-->&quot;</A>

 <LI>This feature isn't supported on all systems.  All DOS and Windows,

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-delivery-status-notification"--></H1>

This feature affects the behavior of Alpine's mail sending.  If set, this
feature enables a subcommand in the composer's &quot;Send?&quot; confirmation
prompt.  The subcommand allows you to tell Alpine to request the type of
Delivery Status Notification (DSN) that you would like.  Most users will
be happy with the default, and need not enable this feature.
<P>
If the feature
<A HREF="h_config_send_wo_confirm">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_send-without-confirm"-->&quot;</A> is set,
then this feature has no effect and the type of DSN is not selectable.

<P>
Turning on this feature and then turning on the DSNOpts from the send
prompt reveals four on-off toggles at the bottom of the screen.
The &quot;X&quot; command toggles between NoErrRets and ErrRets.  NoErrRets requests
that no notification be returned to you, even if there is a delivery
failure.  The &quot;D&quot; key toggles between Delay and NoDelay.  This tells the
server that you are willing (or not) to receive delay notifications, which
happen when there is an unusual delay at some mail server (in that mail
server's opinion).  The &quot;S&quot; key toggles between Success and NoSuccess.
Success requests that you be sent a DSN message when the message is
successfully delivered to the recipients mailbox.  Setting NoErrRets will
automatically turn off Delay and Success notification, and will flip the
toggles to show that.  Similarly, turning on Delay and/or Success will
automatically toggle the &quot;X&quot; key to ErrRets.  The fourth command, the
&quot;H&quot; key, toggles between RetHdrs and RetFull.  RetFull requests that
the full message be returned in any failed DSN.  RetHdrs requests that
only the headers be returned in any failed DSN.  Notice that this command
applies only to failed delivery status reports.  For delay or success
reports, the full message is never returned, only the headers are returned.

<P>
If you don't enable the DSN feature or if you don't turn it on for a
particular message, the default is that you will be notified about failures,
you might be notified about delays, and you won't be notified about
successes.  You will usually receive the full message back when there is
a failure.

<P>
If you turn on the DSNOpts the default is to return as much information as
possible to you.  That is, by default, the Success and Delay options are
turned on and the full message will be returned on failure.

<P>
The sending prompt will display the current DSN request (if any) in a
shorthand form.  It will be:

<P><CENTER>[Never]</CENTER>

<P>
if you have requested NoErrRets.  Otherwise, it will look something like:

<P><CENTER>[FDS-Hdrs]</CENTER>

<P>
The &quot;F&quot; will always be there, indicating that you will be notified
of failures.  (Alpine doesn't provide a way to request no failure notification
and at the same time request either success or delay notification.  The only
way to request no failure notifications is to request no notifications at
all with NoErrRets.)  The &quot;D&quot; and/or &quot;S&quot; will be present if you have
requested Delay and/or Success notification.  If one of those is missing,
that means you are requesting no notification of the corresponding type.
After the dash it will say either Hdrs or Full.  Hdrs means to return only
the headers and Full means to return the full message (applies to
failure notifications only).

<P>
NOTE: This feature relies on your system's mail transport agent or
configured
<A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_smtp-server"-->&quot;</A>
having the negotiation mechanism introduced in
&quot;Extended SMTP&quot; (ESMTP) and the specific extension called
&quot;Delivery Status Notification&quot; (DSN).  If the mail tranport agent you
are using doesn't support DSN, a short warning will be shown to you on
the message line at the bottom of the screen after you send your message,
but your message will have been sent anyway.

<P>
Note that DSNs don't provide a mechanism to request read receipts.  That
is, if you request notification on success you are notified when the
message is delivered to the mailbox, not when the message is read.

<P>
ESMTP allows for graceful migration to upgraded mail transfer agents, but
it is possible that this feature might cause problems for some servers.

Enabling this feature will cause Alpine to only test for the existence of

When you are running Alpine you will sometimes be asked for a password

Normally each password character you type will cause an asterisk to echo

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-flowed-text"--></H1>
<P>
Alpine generates flowed text where possible.
The method for generating flowed text is defined by
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3676.txt">RFC 3676</A>,
the benefit of doing so is
to send message text that can properly be viewed both on normal width displays
and on displays with smaller or larger than normal screen widths.
With flowed text, a space at the end of a line tells the receiving mail
client that the following line belongs to the same paragraph.
Quoted text will also be affected, with only the innermost
level of &quot;&gt;&quot; quoting being followed by a space.
However, if you have changed the
<A HREF="h_config_reply_indent_string">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"-->&quot;</A>
so that it is not equal to the default value of &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&quot;, then
quoted text will not be flowed.
For this reason, we recommend that you leave your
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"-->&quot; set to the default.
<P>
This feature turns off the generation of flowed text, as it might be
desired to more tightly control how a message is displayed on the receiving end.
<P>
If this feature is <EM>not</EM> set, you can control on a message by message
basis whether or not flowed text is generated.
You do this by typing ^V at the Send confirmation prompt that you get
after typing ^X to send a message.
^V is a toggle that turns flowing off and back on if typed again.
If for some reason flowing cannot be done on a particular message, then the
^V command will not be available.
This would be the case, for example, if this feature was set, or if your
&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"-->&quot; was set to a non-default value.
If the feature
<A HREF="h_config_send_wo_confirm">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_send-without-confirm"-->&quot;</A> is set,
then the opportunity to control on a message by message basis
whether or not flowed text is generated is lost.
<P>
When this feature is not set and you have typed ^V to turn off flowing,
the Send confirmation prompt will change to look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Send message (not flowed)?</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<A HREF="h_config_strip_ws_before_send">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_strip-whitespace-before-send"-->&quot;</A> will
also turn off the sending of flowed text messages, but it differs in that
it also trims all trailing white space from a message before sending it.
<P>
If alternate editors are used extensively, be aware that a message will still
be sent flowed if this feature is unset.  In most cases this will be fine,
but if the editor has a &quot;flowed text&quot; mode, it would be best to
use that.

By default, trailing whitespace is not stripped from
a message before sending.  Trailing whitespace should have no effect on an
email message, and in flowed text can aid in delimiting paragraphs.
However, the old behavior of stripping trailing whitespace was in place
to better deal with older clients that couldn't handle certain types of
text encodings.  This feature restores the old behavior
<P>
Trailing whitespace is of aid to flowed-text-formatted messages, which are

When you reply to a message, a series of questions are asked that

to set values that could override defaults set in Alpine's main 
configuration screen. As a result, this menu allows you to configure even 
more features than you would be able to do without this option. For 
example, this menu always allows you to override or select a <A

<A HREF="h_config_prefix_editing"><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-reply-indent-string-editing"--></A>.
The full list of options can be found below.
<P>
Here is an example of how this option works. After you press Reply,
if you see &quot;A Inc Attach&quot; in the menu, it means that 
if you press &quot;A&quot;, then Alpine will include the attachments
of the original message, and the default is not to include them. 
Conversely, if you see &quot;A No Attach&quot; 
then by pressing &quot;A&quot; Alpine will not include
attachments in your reply, and the default is that Alpine will 
include them in your reply. The value that you see when you 
start your reply is controlled by the option
<A HREF="h_config_attach_in_reply">
<!--#echo var="FEAT_include-attachments-in-reply"-->
</A>. If the feature is enabled, then Alpine will display 
&quot;A No Attach&quot; to override the default behavior. You can
toggle between the two values of this option by pressing &quot;A&quot;.
Remember that the value that you see in the menu is the action that will 
be done when you press the associated command.
<P>
Below are your options:
<OL>
<LI><B>A</B>: This determines if Alpine will include or not the 
attachments sent to you in the message that you are replying to. The default 
is to use the value of the configuration option 
<A HREF="h_config_attach_in_reply"><!--#echo var="FEAT_include-attachments-in-reply"--></A> and can be overriden by using this command.

<LI><B>H</B>: This command determines if the headers of a message are
included in the body of the message that is being replied to. By default 
Alpine will use the value of the configuration option 
<A HREF="h_config_include_header"><!--#echo var="FEAT_include-header-in-reply"--></A>. 
Observe that by toggling this option to include headers, text will be toggled
to be included by default.

<LI><B>R</B>: Can be used to set a role different from the default.

<LI><B>S</B>: Determines if Alpine will strip the signature from a 
message. The default is to strip the signature when the message is not
viewed in headers mode, and you either have enabled
<A HREF="h_config_sigdashes"><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-sigdashes"--></A> 
or
<A HREF="h_config_strip_sigdashes"><!--#echo var="FEAT_strip-from-sigdashes-on-reply"--></A>.

<LI><B>Ctrl-R</B>: Can be used to edit the 
<A HREF="h_config_reply_indent_string">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_reply-indent-string"-->&quot;</A>.
</OL>
<P>
In order to include the text of the original message in the reply
you either need to press 'y' to include the original text, or 'n' to 
exclude it from the reply. Pressing return will execute the default 
action, which is to include text only if the option
<A HREF="h_config_auto_include_reply"><!--#echo var="FEAT_include-text-in-reply"--></A>
is enabled. However, notice that the default is to include text if you edit the 
reply indent string or if you explicitly set through this menu that you
want headers included in the reply message.

By default, permission for others to &quot;talk&quot; to your terminal is turned
off when you are running Alpine.  When this feature is set, permission is
instead turned on.  If enabled, you may see unexpected messages in the
middle of your Alpine screen from someone attempting to contact you via the
&quot;talk&quot; program.

<P>
NOTE: The &quot;talk&quot; program has nothing to do with Alpine or email.  The 
talk daemon on your system will attempt to print a message on your screen 
when someone else is trying to contact you.  If you wish to see these
messages while you are running Alpine, you should enable this feature.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-mouse-in-xterm"--></H1>

This feature controls whether or not an X terminal mouse can be used with
Alpine.  If set, and the $DISPLAY variable indicates that an X terminal is
being used, the left mouse button on the mouse can be used to select text
or commands.
Clicking on a command at the bottom of the screen will behave as if you had
typed that command.
Clicking on an index line will move the current message highlight to
that line.
Double-clicking on an index line will view the message.
Double-clicking on a link will view the link.
<P>
This type of mouse support will also work in some terminal emulators which are
not actually X terminals, but which have extra code to support the xterm
style mouse.
For those emulators you not only need to turn this feature on but you also
have to set the $DISPLAY environment variable even though it isn't needed
for your terminal.
That will cause Alpine to think that it is an xterm and to properly interpret the
escape sequences sent by the mouse.
<P>
Note: if this feature is set, the behavior of X terminal cut-and-paste is
also modified.  It is sometimes possible to hold the shift key down while clicking
left or middle mouse buttons for the normal xterm cut/paste operations.

When enabled, it checks to see if any of the addresses in the To or Cc
fields of the message you are replying to is one of your addresses.
If it is, and there is only one of them, then that address is used as
the From address in the message you are composing.
In other words, you will be using a From address that is the same
as the To address that was used to get the mail to you in the first place.

This feature modifies the behavior of Alpine's composer.  Setting this
feature causes Alpine to offer the "^R Replace" subcommand, which
allows you to search and replace text strings in a message you are composing, 
inside the "^W Where is" command.  

<P>

To search and replace text, first enter the text to be replaced at the 
"Search: " prompt.  Then, rather than pressing Enter to just search for that
text, press ^R, which turns the prompt into 

<P>

Search (to replace): 

<P>

and then press Enter.  The cursor will highlight the first occurrence 
of the text string you entered, and the prompt will show: 

<P>

Replace "<your text string>" with : 

<P>

where <your text string> is what you entered at the previous prompt;
here, enter the replacement text.  To only replace the highlighted 
occurrence, simply press Enter now; to replace all occurrences in the 
message, press ^X (Repl All), then Enter.  You will then be asked to confirm 
each replacement.

<P>

The command ^R toggles between "Replace" and "Don't Replace"; its subcommand
^X toggles between "Replace All" and "Replace One."

If you previously searched for text in a message, it will be offered for 
re-use as part of the prompt, shown in [ ] brackets.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_prefer-plain-text"--></H1>

A message being viewed may contain alternate versions of the same content.
Those alternate versions are supposed to be ordered by the sending software such that the
first alternative is the least preferred and the last alternative is the
most preferred. Alpine will normally display the most-preferred version that
it knows how to display. This is most often encountered where the two
alternate versions are a plain text version and an HTML version, with the
HTML version listed last as the most preferred.
<P>
If this option is set, then any plain text version will be preferred to
all other versions.
<P>
When viewing a message there is a command &quot;A TogglePreferPlain&quot;,
which will temporarily change the sense of this option.
If this option is set you will first see the plain text version of a
message.
If you then type the &quot;A&quot; command, you will see the most preferred version,
most likely HTML, instead.
Typing the &quot;A&quot; command a second time will switch it back.
Alternatively, if the present option is not set you will originally see
the most preferred version of the message and typing &quot;A&quot; will switch to
the plain text version.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_pass-control-characters-as-is"--></H1>

It is probably not useful to set this option.
This is a legacy option left behind &quot;just in case&quot;.
Multi-byte characters that have an octet that has the same
value as a control character are permitted through whether or not
this option is turned on.
<P>
This feature controls how certain characters contained in messages are
displayed.
If set, all characters in a message will be sent to the
screen. Normally, control characters are displayed as shown below to
avoid a garbled screen and to 
avoid inadvertently changing terminal setup parameters.
Control characters are usually displayed as two character sequences like
<P><CENTER><SAMP> ^C </SAMP></CENTER><P>
for Control-C,
<P><CENTER><SAMP> ^[ </SAMP></CENTER><P>
for ESCAPE,
<P><CENTER><SAMP> ^? </SAMP></CENTER><P>
for DELETE, and
<P><CENTER><SAMP> ~E </SAMP></CENTER><P>
for the character with value 133 (0x85).
(The DEL character is displayed as ^?, regular control characters are displayed
as the character ^ followed by the character obtained by adding the
five low-order bits of the character to 0x40, and the C1
control characters 0x80 - 0x9F are displayed as the character ~ followed by the
character obtained by adding the
five low-order bits of the character to 0x40.)
Sometimes, in cases where changing a single control character into a
two-character sequence would confuse Alpine's display routines,
a question mark is substituted for the control character.
<P>
If you wish to filter out regular control characters but pass the
so-called C1 control characters (0x80 <= char < 0xA0) through unchanged, then
you may leave this feature unset and set the feature <A HREF="h_config_pass_c1_control"><!--#echo var="FEAT_pass-c1-control-characters-as-is"--></A> instead.

This feature controls an aspect of Alpine's message sending.  When enabled,
Alpine will send a VERB (i.e., VERBose) command early in the posting process
intended to cause the SMTP server to provide a more detailed account of
the transaction.  This feature is typically only useful to system
administrators and other support personel as an aid in troublshooting
problems.

Note, this feature relies on a specific capability of the system's mail
transport agent or configured

It is possible that this
feature will cause problems for some tranport agents, and may result in
sending failure.  In addition, as the verbose output comes from the mail
transport agent, it is likely to vary from one system to another.

Normally, when you use the TAB <A HREF="h_common_nextnew">NextNew</A>
command and there is a problem checking a folder, you are asked
whether you want to continue with the search in the following folder or not.
This question gives you a chance to stop the NextNew processing.
(The checking problem might be caused by the fact that the folder does not
exist, or by an authentication problem, or by a server problem
of some sort.)
<P>

If this feature is set you will not be asked.
It will be assumed that you do want to continue.

Many of the prompts that ask for input in the status line near the
bottom of the screen will respond to Up Arrow and Down Arrow
with the history of previous entries.
For example, in the MESSAGE INDEX screen when you use the WhereIs
command the text you entered will be remembered and can be recalled
by using the Up Arrow key.
Another example, when saving a message the folders saved to will
be remembered and can be recalled using the arrow keys.
<P>
In the Save prompt, some users prefer that the Up and Down arrow keys
be used for the Previous Collection and Next Collection commands
instead of for a history of previous saves.
If this option is set the Up and Down arrow keys will become synonyms for the
Previous Collection and Next Collection (^P and ^N) commands in the
prompt for the name of a folder to Save to or in the prompt for the
name of a folder to GoTo.
When this feature is not set (the default), ^P and ^N will change the
collection and the arrow keys will show the history.

If you have roles, when you Reply to or Forward a message, or Compose
a new message, Alpine
will search through your roles for one that matches.
Normally, if no matches are found you will be placed into the composer
with no opportunity to select a role.
If this feature is set, then you will be asked to confirm that you don't
want a role.
This will give you the opportunity to select a role (with the ^T command).
If you confirm no role with a Return, you will be placed in
the composer with no role.
You may also confirm with either an &quot;N&quot; or a &quot;Y&quot;.
These behave the same as if you pressed the Return.
(The &quot;N&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; answers are available because they
match what you might type if there was a role match.)
<P>
If you are using the alternate form of the Compose command called
&quot;Role&quot;, then all of your roles will be available to you,

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_news-deletes-across-groups"--></H1>

This feature controls what Alpine does when you delete a message in a
newsgroup that appears in more than one newsgroup.  Such a message
is sometimes termed a &quot;crossposting&quot; in that it was posted
across several newsgroups.

<P>
Alpine's default behavior when you delete such a message is to remove
only the copy in the current newsgroup from view when you use the
&quot;Exclude&quot; command or the next time you visit the newsgroup.

<P>
Enabling this feature causes Alpine to remove every occurrence of the
message from all newsgroups it appears in and to which you are
subscribed.

<P>
NOTE: As currently implemented, enabling this feature may increase the
time it takes the Expunge command and newsgroup closing to complete.

MESSAGE INDEX of only the messages in that thread.
If you press the Next command with the last message in the thread highlighted
you will normally be asked if you want to &quot;View next thread?&quot;,

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: <!--#echo var="VAR_keyword-surrounding-chars"--></H1>

This option controls a minor aspect of Alpine's MESSAGE INDEX and MESSAGE
TEXT screens.
If you have modified the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_index_format"><!--#echo var="VAR_index-format"--></A>&quot; option
so that either the &quot;SUBJKEY&quot; or &quot;SUBJKEYINIT&quot; tokens
are used to display keywords or their initials along with the Subject; then
this option may be used to modify the resulting display slightly.
By default, the keywords or initials displayed for these tokens will be
surrounded with curly braces ({ and }) and a trailing space.
For example, if keywords &quot;Work&quot; and &quot;Now&quot; are set for
a message, the &quot;SUBJKEY&quot; token will normally look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{Work Now} actual subject</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and the SUBJKEYINIT token would look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{WN} actual subject</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The default character before the keywords is the left brace ({) and the
default after the keywords is the right brace followed by a space (} ).
<P>
This option allows you to change that.
You should set it to two values separated by a space.
The values may be quoted if they include space characters.
So, for example, the default value could be specified explicitly by setting this
option to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP><!--#echo var="VAR_keyword-surrounding-chars"-->="{" "}&nbsp;"</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The first part wouldn't need to be quoted (but it doesn't hurt).
The second part does need the quotes because it includes a space character.
If you wanted to change the braces to brackets you could use
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP><!--#echo var="VAR_keyword-surrounding-chars"-->="[" "]&nbsp;"</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Inside the quotes you can use backslash quote to mean quote, so
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP><!--#echo var="VAR_keyword-surrounding-chars"-->="&#92;"" "&#92;" "</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would produce
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>"Work Now" actual subject</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
It is also possible to color keywords in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
<P>
It is not possible to change the fact that a space character is used to
separate the keywords if more than one keyword is set for a message.
It is also not possible to change the fact that there are no separators
between the keyword initials if more than one keyword is set.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_ignore-size-changes"--></H1>

When you have an account residing in an IMAP server, Alpine records the 
size of each message as reported by the server. However, when Alpine saves 
a message in such IMAP server, Alpine will compute the size of the message 
independently, from the data it received. If these two numbers do not 
match for a message, Alpine asks you if you still want to take the risk of 
saving such message, since data corruption or loss of data could result 
from this save.

<P>
Sometimes the root of this problem is that the IMAP server does not 
compute sizes correctly, and there will not be loss of information when 
saving such message. Enabling this feature will make Alpine ignore such 
error and continue saving the message without producing any warnings or 
ever stopping the process, as if there had not been any error. This option 
applies to all IMAP servers that you use, so if you enable this feature, 
size discrepancy warnings will not be given for any IMAP server you 
connect to.

<P>
Example of a server where you could reproduce this problem is the Gmail 
IMAP server. Another example can be found in some versions of the Exchange 
server.

<P>
It is recommended that this feature be disabled most of the time and only 
enabled when you find a server which you can determine that has the above 
mentioned defect, but be disabled again after making the save operation 
succeed.

Modern terminal emulators are usually capable of displaying colors.
<P>
The available options include:
<P>

<DL>
<DT>no-color</DT>
<DD>Don't use color.
</DD>

<DT>use-termdef</DT>
<DD>In order to decide if your terminal is capable of color, Alpine looks in
the terminal capabilities database, TERMINFO or TERMCAP, depending on
how Alpine was compiled.
This is a good option to choose if you switch between a color and a non-color
terminal with the same Alpine configuration.
Alpine will know to use color on the color terminal because it is described
in the termcap entry, and Alpine will know to use black and white on the
non-color terminal.
The Alpine Technical Notes
<CENTER><SAMP><A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/alpine/tech-notes/">http://www.washington.edu/alpine/tech-notes/</A></SAMP></CENTER>
have more information on configuring a TERMCAP or TERMINFO
entry for color Alpine.
This is usually something a system administrator does.
</DD>

<DT>force-ansi-8color</DT>
<DD>This is probably the setting that most people should use.
Because setting up a termcap entry is confusing and because the
terminal capabilities database is often not correctly configured for color,
this choice and the next may be easier for you to use.
If your terminal emulator responds to ANSI color escape sequences, which
many do, this option will cause Alpine to believe your terminal will respond
to the escape sequences that produce eight different foreground and background
colors.
The escape sequences used to set the foreground colors are

  <P><CENTER>ESC&nbsp;[&nbsp;3&nbsp;&lt;color_number&gt;&nbsp;m</CENTER><P>

where the color_number is an ASCII digit between 0 and 7.
The numbers 0 through 7 should correspond to the colors black, red, green,
yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.
Some terminal emulators use a pre-ANSI scheme that swaps
the colors blue and red and the colors yellow and cyan.
This will cause the default colors to be different, but other than that
things should work fine.
There is also a 9th color available, the last one shown, which is the default
color from the terminal emulator.
When used as a background color some people refer to this color as
&quot;transparent&quot;, which is why the letters &quot;TRAN&quot; are
shown in the color swatch of the SETUP COLOR screen.
The foreground transparent color is shown as
the color of the &quot;TRAN&quot; text.
(The transparent color will not work correctly in a PC-Alpine configuration.)
The escape sequences used to set the background colors are the same
as for the foreground colors except a &quot;4&quot; replaces the &quot;3&quot;.
The escape sequences for foreground and background default colors (transparent)
are 39m and 49m.
<P>
Note: With the Tera Term terminal emulator this setting works well.
You should also have the Tera Term &quot;Full color&quot; option turned OFF.
You may find the &quot;Full color&quot; option in Tera Term's &quot;Setup&quot;
menu, in the &quot;Window&quot; submenu.
</DD>

<DT>force-ansi-16color</DT>
<DD>Many terminal emulators know about the same eight colors above
plus eight more.
This option attempts to use all 16 colors.
The same escape sequences as for the eight-color terminal are used
for the first eight colors.
The escape sequences used to set foreground colors 8-15 are the same as
for 0-7 except the &quot;3&quot; is replaced with a &quot;9&quot;.
The background color sequences for colors 8-15 are the same as for 0-7
except the &quot;4&quot; is replaced with &quot;10&quot;.
You can tell if the 16 colors are working by turning on this option
and then going into one of the color configuration screens, for example,
the configuration screen for Normal Color.
If you see 16 different colors to select from (plus a 17th for
the transparent color), it's working.
</DD>

<DT>force-xterm-256color</DT>
<DD>Some versions of xterm (and some other terminal emulators)
have support for 256 colors.
The escape sequences used to set the foreground colors are

  <P><CENTER>ESC&nbsp;[&nbsp;38&nbsp;;&nbsp;5&nbsp;;&nbsp;&lt;color_number&gt;&nbsp;m</CENTER><P>

where the color_number is an ASCII digit between 0 and 255.
Background colors are the same with the 38 replaced with a 48.
The numbers 0 through 15 are probably similar to the 16 color version
above, then comes a 6x6x6 color cube, followed by 24 colors of gray.
The terminal default (transparent) color is the 257th color at the bottom.
Some terminal emulators will misinterpret these escape sequences causing
the terminal to blink or overstrike characters or to do something else
undesirable.
<P>
The PuTTY terminal emulator has an option called &quot;Allow terminal to
use xterm 256-colour mode&quot; which allows PuTTY to work well with
this 256-color setting.

</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The normal default is &quot;no-color&quot;.
<P>

Once you've turned on color you may set the
colors of many objects on the screen individually.
For example, you may add colors to the status letters on the MESSAGE
INDEX page.
Most categories of color that Alpine supports are configurable here.
For example, &quot;Normal Color&quot;
is the color used to display most of the text in Alpine, and
&quot;Reverse Color&quot; is used to display highlighted text, such as the
current message in the MESSAGE INDEX.
<P>
Lines in the MESSAGE INDEX may also be colored.
Use Setup Rules to get to the Indexcolor configuration screen.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_try-alternative-authentication-driver-first"--></H1>

This feature affects how Alpine connects to IMAP servers.
It's utility has largely been overtaken by events,
but it may still be useful in some circumstances.
If you only connect to modern IMAP servers that support
&quot;TLS&quot; you can ignore this feature.

<P>
Details:

<P>
By default, Alpine will attempt to connect to an IMAP server on the
normal IMAP service port (143), and if the server offers &quot;Transport Layer
Security&quot; (TLS) and Alpine has been compiled with encryption capability,
then a secure (encrypted) session will be negotiated.

<P>
With this feature enabled, before connecting on the normal IMAP port, Alpine
will first attempt to connect to an alternate IMAP service port (993) used
specifically for encrypted IMAP sessions via the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) method.
If the SSL attempt fails, Alpine will then try the default
behavior described in the previous paragraph.

<P>
TLS negotiation on the normal port is preferred, and supersedes the use of
SSL on port 993, but older servers may not provide TLS support.
This feature may be convenient when accessing IMAP servers that do not support
TLS, but do support SSL connections on port 993.
However, it is important to understand that with this feature enabled,
Alpine will <EM>attempt</EM> to make a secure connection if that is possible,
but it will proceed to make an insecure connection if that is the only
option offered by the server, or if the Alpine in question has been built
without encryption capability.

<P>
Note that this feature specifies a per-user (or system-wide) default
behavior, but host/folder specification flags may be used to control the
behavior of any specific connection.
This feature interacts with some of
the possible host/folder path specification flags as follows:

<P>
The <SAMP>/tls</SAMP> host flag, for example,

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{foo.example.com/tls}INBOX</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
will over-ride this feature for the specified host by bypassing the
SSL connection attempt.
Moreover, with <SAMP>/tls</SAMP> specified,
the connection attempt will fail if the
service on port 143 does not offer TLS support.

<P>
The <SAMP>/ssl</SAMP> host flag, for example,

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{foo.example.com/ssl}INBOX</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
will insist on an SSL connection for the specified host,
and will fail if the SSL service on port 993 is not available.
Alpine will not subsequently retry a connection
on port 143 if <SAMP>/ssl</SAMP> is specified.

<P>
Normally, when a filename is supplied that lacks a leading &quot;path&quot;
component, Alpine assumes the file exists in the user's home directory.
Under Windows operating systems, this definition isn't always clear.  This 
feature allows you to explictly set where Alpine should look for files
without a leading path.

<P>

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_save-will-quote-leading-froms"--></H1>

This feature controls an aspect of the Save command (and also the way
outgoing messages are saved to an FCC folder).  If set, Alpine will add
a leading &quot;>&quot; character in front of message lines beginning with &quot;From&quot; 
when they are saved to another folder, including lines syntactically
distinguishable from the type of message separator line commonly used on
Unix systems.

<P>
The default behavior is that a &quot;>&quot; will be prepended only to lines
beginning with &quot;From &quot; that might otherwise be confused with a message
separator line on Unix systems.  If pine is the only mail program you use,
this default is reasonable.  If another program you use has trouble
displaying a message with an unquoted &quot;From &quot; saved by Alpine, you should
enable this feature.  This feature only applies to the common Unix mailbox
format that uses message separator lines beginning with &quot;From &quot;.  If
Alpine has been configured to use a different mailbox format (possibly
incompatible with other mail programs), then this issue does not arise,
and the feature is irrelevant.

Sets the color Alpine uses for the labels of the keys in the two-line
menu at the bottom of the screen.
For example, some of the screens have a &quot;P PrevMsg&quot; command.
This option sets the color used when displaying &quot;PrevMsg&quot;.
The foreground color is the color of the actual character and the
background color is the color of the area behind the character.
By default, the KeyLabel Color is the same as the Normal Color.
<P>
WARNING: Some terminal emulators have the property that the screen will scroll
down one line whenever a character is written to the character cell in the
lower right corner of the screen.
Alpine can usually avoid writing a character in that corner of the screen.
However, if you have defined a KeyLabel Color then Alpine does have to write
a character in that cell in order to color the cell correctly.
If you find that your display sometimes scrolls up a line this could be
the problem.
The most obvious symptom is probably that the titlebar at the top of the
screen scrolls off the screen.
Try setting KeyLabel Color to Default to see if that fixes the problem.

If a line begins with a &gt; character (or space followed by &gt;)
it is considered a quote.
That line will be given the Quote1 Color (first level quote).
If there is a second level of quoting then the Quote2 Color will be used.
Alpine considers there to be a second level of quoting if that first &gt; is
followed by another &gt; (or space followed by &gt;).
If there are characters other than whitespace and &gt; signs, then it isn't
considered another level of quoting.
Similarly, if there is a third level of quoting the Quote3 Color will be
used.
If there are more levels after that the Quote Colors are re-used.
If you define all three colors then it would repeat like Color1, Color2, Color3,
Color1, Color2, Color3, ...
If you only define the first two it would be
Color1, Color2, Color1, Color2, ...
If you define only the Quote1 Color, then the entire quote would be that
color regardless of the quoting levels.
By default, the Quote1 Color is black characters on a greenish-blue background;
the Quote2 Color is black characters on a dull yellow background; and
the Quote3 Color is black characters on a green background.

This is a special color supported by some terminal emulators.
It is intended to result in the default foreground or background color
from the terminal emulator.
This is the color the terminal was displaying characters in before you started Alpine.
The reason it is called Transparent is because you could set the foreground color
to some specific color, like Red, and then set the background color to the
Transparent Color. If it works as expected, the background color from the terminal
window in which Alpine is running will show through but with the Red characters
in the foreground.

This is a special color that simply means to leave the color alone.
It is useful for Index symbols and for Keyword Colors used in the Subject
field of an index line.
The most likely use is to set an explicit foreground color and then set
the background color to the None Color.
That will cause the symbol or keyword to be drawn in the foreground color
with a background equal to whatever color the rest of the index line is already
drawn in.
You will see no visible effect unless you have assigned Indexcolor Rules to
color index lines or you have set an actual color for the Reverse Color.

For example, you may set the color of the Subject header or the From header.
The foreground color is the color of the actual character and the
background color is the color of the area behind the character.
<P>
In addition to setting the colors for particular headers (like the Subject)
you may also set a color to be used for all headers unless overridden by a

For example, if you are working on a color for the Subject header and
you fill in a pattern of &quot;important&quot;, then only Subjects that
contain the word &quot;important&quot; will be colored.
<P>
For address headers (like From and To) and for the Newsgroups header,
a pattern match will cause only the matched addresses or newsgroups to be
colored.
If there is no pattern to match, then all of the addresses or newsgroups
in the relevant header will be colored.
<P>
The matching pattern may be a comma-separated list of patterns to match
instead of a single pattern.
For example, you could use the pattern &quot;important,urgent&quot; which would
cause a match if either the word &quot;important&quot; or the word
&quot;urgent&quot; appeared in the value of the header.
You could list several comma-separated email addresses in the Header
From Color pattern so that those addresses will be colored when any of
them appear in the From header.

<H2>Description of the Setup Color Screen</H2>

From this screen you may turn on color and set the colors of
various parts of the Alpine display.
For help on turning on color move your cursor into the Color Style section
at the top of the Setup Color screen and ask for help.

<P>
There are several sections in the Setup Color Screen.
At the top are some settings that handle the style of color used
with your terminal emulator (UNIX only), and some settings that
control how the current indexline and the titlebar are colored.
After that comes a long section called GENERAL COLORS that allows
you to set the color of many elements in the Alpine screens.
For example, the color of the titlebar, status messages,
selectable links, quotes and signatures in messages, and so on.
After that is a section called INDEX COLORS that allows you to
set the colors of various pieces of the displayed index lines in
the MESSAGE INDEX screen.
The next section is HEADER COLORS. This is for coloring headers of
messages in the MESSAGE TEXT screen in just about any way you would like.
Finally, the KEYWORD COLORS section allows you to highlight
<A HREF="h_config_keywords"><!--#echo var="VAR_keywords"--></A>
in the MESSAGE INDEX screen.

<P>
To change a color, highlight the color you want to change (for example,
the Status Color) by moving
the cursor into it.
You may want to read the help text for the color to see a brief desription
of what you are coloring.
Then press &quot;C&quot; for Change to set the color to something new.
That will put you into a screen with two columns of colors, one for
the foreground color and one for the background color.
The foreground color is just the color you want the actual characters
to be and the background color is the color of the rest of the rectangle
behind the characters.
Select the foreground and background colors desired by using the Next and
Prev keys to highlight the color, and the * command to select it.
<P>
To set a color to its default value, set the X in the Default line at
the bottom of the list of colors.
<P>

The HEADER COLORS section is a little bit different from the others.
Besides coloring the specific fields that Alpine knows about, you may also
color specific header fields when viewing a message in the MESSAGE TEXT
screen.
For example, you may color the Subject header a particular color.
There are a few commands for use with headers.
The &quot;AddHeader&quot; command adds a section to the color
configuration screen that allows you to set the color for that header.
You'll be asked for the name of the header field you want to color.
If you wanted to color the Subject, you would answer
with the word &quot;subject&quot;.
Once you've added a header field, the color setting works just like the
other color fields, except that there is an additional line on the
configuration screen labeled &quot;Pattern to match&quot;.
If you leave that blank, then the whole field for that header will always
be colored.
However, if you give a pattern to match, the coloring will only take place
if there is a match for that pattern in the value of the field.
For example, if you are working on a color for the Subject header and
you fill in a pattern of &quot;important&quot;, then only Subjects that
contain the word &quot;important&quot; will be colored.
<P>
The &quot;DeleteHdr&quot; command removes a header section from the
configuration altogether.
The &quot;Shuffle&quot; command changes the order of header sections.
This is only necessary if you use header sections with pattern fields.
For example, if you have two Subject sections, one with one pattern and
another with another pattern, and the subject for a particular message
happens to match both, then the color from the first match is used.
<P>

The command &quot;RestoreDefs&quot; will restore all of the default colors.
Each section will change to the default value used for that section when
color is first enabled.
When you restore all default colors the color settings for the Header Colors
will be unset (since that's the default), but the header fields you've
added will remain so that you may easily reset them.
In order to get rid of them completely you'd have to use
the &quot;DeleteHdr&quot; command.

<P>
Remember that <A HREF="h_rules_incols">Index Line Colors</A>
may be set with matching rules and that is configured separately from
the rest of the color settings described here.
It is configured in the Setup/Rules/Indexcolors section of the configuration screen
instead of in the Setup/Kolor section.

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_news-approximates-new-status"--></H1>

This feature causes certain messages to be marked as "New" in the
MESSAGE INDEX of newsgroups.
This feature is set by default.

<P>

When opening a newsgroup, Alpine will consult your "newsrc" file and
determine the last message you have previously disposed of via the "D"
key.  If this feature is set, any subsequent messages will be shown in the
Index with an "N", and the first of these messages will be highlighted.
Although this is only an approximation of true "New" or "Unseen"
status, it provides a useful cue to distinguish more-or-less recent
messages from those you have seen previously, but are not yet ready to
mark deleted.

<P>

Background: your "newsrc" file (used to store message status information
for newsgroups) is only capable of storing a single flag, and Alpine uses
this to record whether or not you are "done with" a message, as
indicated by marking the message as "Deleted".  Unfortunately, this
means that Alpine has no way to record exactly which messages you have
previously seen, so it normally does not show the "N" status flag for
any messages in a newsgroup. This feature enables a starting
*approximation* of seen/unseen status that may be useful.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_expose-hidden-config"--></H1>

If set, this causes configuration options and features that are normally
hidden from view to be editable in the Setup/Config screen.

<P>
The purpose of this feature is to allow you to change configuration
features and variables that are normally hidden.
This is particularly useful if you are using a remote configuration,
where it is difficult to edit the contents manually, but it may also be used
on a local pinerc configuration file.
<P>
If set, several configuration variables and features that are normally
hidden from view will show up in the Setup/Configuration screen.
They will be at the bottom of the configuration screen.
You can find them by searching for the words &quot;hidden configuration&quot;.
<P>

Note that this is an advanced feature that should be used with care.
The reason that this part of the configuration is normally hidden is because
there is a significant potential for causing problems if you change these
variables.
If something breaks after a change try changing it back to see if that is
what is causing the problem.
There are also some variables that are normally hidden because they are
manipulated through Alpine in other ways.
For example, colors are normally set using the Setup/Kolors screen and
the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_address-book"-->&quot; variable is normally set using
the Setup/AddressBooks screen, so there is little reason to edit these directly.
The &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_incoming-folders"-->&quot; variable is normally changed by using
the Add, Delete, and Rename commands in the FOLDER LIST screen,
and the &quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_last-time-prune-questioned"-->&quot; variable is normally used
internally by Alpine and not set directly by the user.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_disable-password-caching"--></H1>

Normally, loginname/password combinations are cached in Alpine so that
you do not have to enter the same password more than once in a session.
A disadvantage to this approach is that the password must be stored in
the memory image of the running Alpine in order that it can be re-used.
In the event that Alpine crashes and produces a core dump, and that core
dump is readable by others, the loginname and password could be read
from the core dump.
<P>
If this feature is set, then the passwords will not be cached and you
will have to retype the password whenever Alpine needs it.
Even with this feature set there is still some chance that the core
file will contain a password, so care should be taken to make the
core files unreadable.
<P>
NOTE: If PASSFILE caching is enabled, this does not disable it.
That is a separate and independent feature.

This feature changes the behavior of Alpine when a login name and password combination

Alpine will ask the user if they wish to save this information in the password file for future

to use it, but in some instances a user might want to save some passwords and not others.
In this case, enabling this feature will make Alpine not add any more passwords to the
password file and will only use the passwords that it already saved. If you wish to allow

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-content-id"--></H1>

This feature changes the behavior of Alpine when sending messages.
It is intended to work around a bug in Microsoft's Outlook XP mail user
agent.
As of this writing, Microsoft has acknowledged the bug but
has not added it to the Knowledge Base.
We have been told that there will be a post-SP1 hotfix for Outlook XP.
This particular bug has bug fix number OfficeQFE:4781.
The nature of the bug is that messages with attachments that
contain a Content-ID header (which standard Alpine attachments do)
do not show the attachment indicator (a paperclip) when viewed with
Outlook XP.
So the user has no indication that the message contains an attachment.

<P>
If this feature is set then Alpine will remove most Content-ID headers
before sending a message.
If an attachment is of type MESSAGE, then the existing Content-ID headers
inside the message will be left intact.
This would only happen with Alpine if a message was forwarded as an attachment
or if a message with a message attached was forwarded.
Similarly if an attachment of type MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE is forwarded,
the Content-ID headers of the alternative parts will not be removed.

<P>
Because the Content-ID header is a standard part of MIME it is possible
that setting this feature will break something.
For example, if an attachment has a Content-ID header that is necessary
for the correct functioning of that attachment, it is possible that Alpine
may remove that header when the attachment is forwarded.
However, it seems fairly safe at this time.

Normally, PC-Alpine will store its window size and position in the
Windows Registry.
This is convenient if you want to use the same remote
configuration from more than one PC.
If you use multiple configuration files to start PC-Alpine, you may want
to store the window size and position in the configuration file instead
of in the Registry.
Setting this feature causes the value to be stored in 
<A HREF="h_config_window_position">Window-Position</A>.

This feature changes the behavior of fetching messages

This works around a bug in Microsoft's SSL/TLS support.
Some versions of Microsoft SSL are not able to read full-sized (16K)
SSL/TLS packets.
Some servers will send such packets and this will
cause PC-Alpine to crash with the error

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_quell-partial-fetching"--></H1>

Partial fetching is a feature of the IMAP protocol.
By default, Alpine
will use partial fetching when copying the contents of a message or attachment
from the IMAP server to Alpine.
This means that the fetch will be done in many
small chunks instead of one big chunk. The main benefit of this approach is
that the fetch becomes interruptible. That is, the user can type <EM>^C</EM>
to stop the fetch early. In some cases partial fetching may cause a performance
problem so that the fetching of data takes significantly longer when partial
fetching is used. Turning on this feature will turn off partial fetching.

<H1>FEATURE: Use System Translation</H1>

UNIX Alpine only.
<P>
Alpine normally uses its own internal software to convert between the multi-byte
representation of characters and the Unicode representation of those
same characters.
It converts from the multi-byte characters your keyboard produces to Unicode,
and from Unicode to the multi-byte characters your display expects.
Alpine also uses its own internal software to decide how much space on
the screen a particular Unicode character will occupy.

<P>
Setting this feature tells Alpine to use the system-supplied routines to
perform these tasks instead.
In particular there are three tasks and three system routines that will
be used for these tasks.

<P>
To convert from multi-byte to Unicode the routine

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>mbstowcs</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

is used.
To convert from Unicode to multi-byte the routine

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>wcrtomb</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

is used.
And to find the screen width a particular Unicode character will
occupy the routine used is

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>wcwidth</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

This feature has been only lightly tested.
The internal routines should normally be used unless you run into
a problem that you think may be solved by using the system routines.
Note that your environment needs to be set up for these
routines to work correctly.
In particular, the LANG or LC_CTYPE variable in your environment will
need to be set.

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_use-subshell-for-suspend"--></H1>

This feature affects Alpine's behavior when process suspension is enabled
and then activated via the Ctrl-Z key.  Alpine suspension allows one to
temporarily interact with the operating system command &quot;shell&quot; 
without
quitting Alpine, and then subsequently resume the still-active Alpine session.
<P>

When the <A HREF="h_config_can_suspend">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-suspend"-->&quot;</A> feature
is set and subsequently the Ctrl-Z key
is pressed, Alpine will normally suspend itself and return temporary control
to Alpine's parent shell process.  However, if this feature is set, Alpine
will instead create an inferior subshell process.  This is useful when the
parent process is not intended to be used interactively.  Examples include
invoking Alpine via the -e argument of the Unix &quot;xterm&quot; program, 
or via a menu system.<P>

Note that one typically resumes a suspended Alpine by entering the Unix
&quot;fg&quot; command, but if this feature is set, it will be necessary to
enter the &quot;exit&quot; command instead.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation"--></H1>

This feature affects Alpine's behavior when sending mail.
By default, this feature is set.
Internet standards
require that all electronic mail messages traversing the global Internet
consist of 7bit ASCII characters unless a pair of cooperating mail 
transfer agents explicitly agree to allow 8bit messages.  In general, 
then, exchanging messages in non-ASCII characters requires MIME encoding.
<P>
However, there are now Internet standards that allow for unencoded 8bit
exchange of messages between cooperating systems.  When this feature is set
Alpine will try to negotiate unencoded 8bit transmission during the
sending process.  Should the negotiation fail, Alpine will fall back to its
ordinary encoding rules. 
<P>
Note, this feature relies on your system's mail transport agent or
configured <A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;<!--#echo var="VAR_smtp-server"-->&quot;</A>
having the negotiation mechanism introduced in
&quot;Extended SMTP&quot; (ESMTP) and the specific extension called
&quot;8BITMIME&quot;. 
<P>
ESMTP allows for graceful migration to upgraded mail transfer agents, but
it is possible that this feature might cause problems for some servers.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-8bit-nntp-posting"--></H1>

This feature affects Alpine's behavior when posting news.  

<P>

The Internet standard for exchanging USENET news messages (RFC-1036)
specifies that USENET messages should conform to Internet mail standards
and contain only 7bit characters, but much of the news transport software
in use today is capable of successfully sending messages containing 8bit
characters.  Hence, many people believe that it is appropriate to send 8bit
news messages without any MIME encoding.

<P>

Moreover, there is no Internet standard for explicitly negotiating 8bit
transfer, as there is for Internet email.  Therefore, Alpine provides the
option of posting unencoded 8bit news messages, though not as the default.
Setting this feature will turn OFF Alpine's MIME encoding of newsgroup
postings that contain 8bit characters. 

<P>

Note, articles may cross a path or pass through news transport software
that is unsafe or even hostile to 8bit characters.  At best this will only
cause the posting to become garbled.  The safest way to transmit 8bit
characters is to leave Alpine's MIME encoding turned on, but recipients
who lack MIME-aware tools are often annoyed when they receive MIME-encoded 
messages.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_tab-uses-unseen-for-next-folder"--></H1>

This feature affects Alpine's behavior when using the TAB
<A HREF="h_common_nextnew">NextNew Command</A>
to move from one folder to the next.
Alpine's usual behavior is to search for folders
with <EM>Recent</EM> messages in them.
Recent messages are messages that have arrived since the last time the
folder was opened.

<P>
Setting this feature causes Alpine to search for <EM>Unseen</EM>
messages instead of Recent messages.
Unseen messages remain Unseen until you view them (or flag then as Seen with
the <A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag Command</A>).
Setting this feature allows you to locate messages you have not read
instead of only recently received messages.
When this feature is set, the feature
<A HREF="h_config_fast_recent">&quot;<!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-fast-recent-test"-->&quot;</A>
will have no effect, so the checking may be slower.

<P>
Another reason why you might want to use this feature is that Alpine sometimes
opens folders implicitly behind the scenes, and this clears the
Recent status of all messages in the folder.
One example where this happens is when Saving or filtering a
message to another folder.
If that message has some <A HREF="h_config_keywords">keywords</A>
set, then because of some shortcomings
in the IMAP specification, the best way to ensure that those keywords are
still set in the saved copy of the message is to open the folder and
set the keywords explicitly.
Because this clears the Recent status of all messages in that folder the
folder will not be found by the NextNew command unless this feature is set.

The description above is not quite correct.
Only directories which potentially may hold messages are hidden if empty.

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_termdef-takes-precedence"--></H1>

This feature may affect Alpine's low-level input routines.  Termcap (or
terminfo, depending on how your copy of Alpine was compiled and linked)
is the name of the database that describes terminal capabilities.  In
particular, it describes the sequences of characters that various keys
will emit.

<P>
An example would be the Up Arrow key on the keyboard.  Up
Arrow is not a distinct character on most Unix systems.  When you press
the Up Arrow key a short sequence of characters are produced.  This
sequence is supposed to be described in the termcap database by the
&quot;ku&quot; capability (or by the &quot;kcuu1&quot; capability if you
are using terminfo instead of termcap).

<P>
By default, Alpine defines some terminal
escape sequences that are commonly used.  For example, the sequence
&quot;ESC&nbsp;O&nbsp;A&quot; is recognized as an Up Arrow key.  The sequence
&quot;ESC&nbsp;[&nbsp;A&quot;
is also recognized as an Up Arrow key.  These are chosen because common
terminals like VT100's or ANSI standard terminals produce these
sequences when you press the Up Arrow key.

<P>
If your system's termcap
(terminfo) database assigns some other function to the sequence
&quot;ESC&nbsp;O&nbsp;A&quot;
it is usually ignored by Alpine.  Also, if your termcap (terminfo)
database assigns a sequence that doesn't begin with an escape
character (<SAMP>ESC</SAMP>) it is usually ignored by Alpine.
This usually works fine
because most terminals emit the escape sequences that Alpine has defined
by default.  We have also found that it is usually better to have these
defaults take precedence over the definitions contained in the database
because the defaults are more likely to be correct than the database.

<P>
There are some terminals where this breaks down.  If you want Alpine to
believe the definitions given in your termcap (terminfo) database in
preference to the defaults the Alpine itself sets up, then you may turn
this feature on.  Then, sequences of characters that are defined in
both termcap (terminfo) and in Alpine's set of defaults will be
interpreted the way that termcap (terminfo) says they should be
interpreted.  Also, if your terminal capabilities database assigns a
sequence that doesn't begin with escape, it will not be ignored.

<TITLE>Rules Behavior Changes in Pine 4.50</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Rules Behavior Changes in Pine 4.50</H1>

In Alpine, Rules that contain unrecognized elements
are ignored.
In most cases, the unrecognized elements will be something that was
added as a new Rules feature in a later version of Alpine.
In versions of Pine <EM>prior</EM> to 4.50, Pine did <EM>not</EM>
ignore rules that contained unrecognized elements.
For example, a new element of Rules that was added in Pine 4.50 is
Age interval.
Suppose you add an Indexcolor rule, using version Pine 4.50 or later, that colors
all messages older than a week red.
Now, if you run Pine 4.44 using that same configuration file, it will not
recognize the Age interval and so will just ignore it.
That means that all messages will match that rule so all messages will
be colored red when using Pine version 4.44.

<P>
This behavior was considered a bug so it is fixed in Alpine and Pine 4.50 and later.
However, since the behavior still exists in versions prior to Pine 4.50 and
since Filtering is a potentially destructive operation, another measure
was taken to attempt to avoid unintentional Filtering of messages.
The first time that you run Alpine or a Pine that is version 4.50 or greater,
the rules in your Filters configuration variable (&quot;Patterns-Filters&quot;)
will be copied to a new Filters configuration variable
with a different name (&quot;Patterns-Filters2&quot;).
From then on, Alpine will continue to use the new
variable.
Of course, Pine version 4.44 or lower will continue to use the old
variable.
That means that if you are using Alpine
and also using a version of Pine that is older than 4.50, they will not
share the configuration information about Filters.
If you make a change in one version you won't see it in the other version.

<P>
Since Scoring can be used to trigger Filtering, the same thing has been
done for Score rules.
The old configuration variable name is (&quot;Patterns-Scores&quot;)
and the new name is (&quot;Patterns-Scores2&quot;).
The same is not true of Role, Indexcolor, and Other rules that are
thought to be less harmful when a mistake is made.

<H1>FILTER FEATURE: Move-Only-if-Not-Deleted</H1>

If this option is set then a message will be moved into the
specified folder only if it is not marked for deletion.
This is useful if you have multiple Alpine sessions running
simultaneously and you don't want messages to be filtered into a
folder more than once.
It is also useful if you want to filter
only the &quot;undeleted&quot; messages in a newsgroup into a folder.
This method is not foolproof.
There may be cases where a message
gets marked deleted and so it is never filtered into the folder.
For example, if you deleted it in another Alpine session or another mail
program that didn't use the filtering rule.

<BODY>
<H1>FILTER FEATURE: Dont-Stop-Even-if-Rule-Matches</H1>

If this option is set then this is a non-terminating rule.
Usually, for each message, Alpine searches through the Filter Rules until
a match is found and then it performs the action associated with that rule.
Rules following the match are not considered.
If this option is set then the search for matches will continue at the next
rule.
<P>
If a non-terminating rule matches then the actions associated with
that rule, except for any implied deletion of the message, are performed
before the match for the next rule is checked.
For example, if the non-terminating rule sets the Important status, then that
status will be set when the next rule is considered.
However, if the non-terminating rule Moves the message, the message will
actually be copied instead of copied and deleted so that it is still there
for the next rule.
A moved message is deleted after all the relevant rules have been checked.
The name of the &quot;Move&quot; action is confusing in this case because
a single message can be moved to more than one folder.
It turns the Move into a Copy instead, but it is still followed by a deletion
at the end.
<P>
This option may be useful if you want to have a single message filtered to
two different folders because it matches two different Patterns.
For example, suppose you normally filter messages to a particular mailing
list into one folder, and messages addressed directly to you into a second
folder.
If a message is sent to both you and the list (and you can tell that by
looking at the headers of the message) this option may give you a convenient
way to capture a copy to each folder.
(It may also cause you to capture two copies to each folder,
depending on whether your mail system delivers one or two copies of the
message to you and on how the list works.)

<TITLE>S/MIME Overview</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>S/MIME Overview</H1>

S/MIME is a standard for the public key encryption and signing of email.
UNIX Alpine contains a basic implementation of S/MIME based on
the <A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</A> libraries. The
same support can be provided using the 
<A HREF="http://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</A> libraries. The
support for S/MIME in PC-Alpine is fully based on the LibreSSL libraries.
To check if this version of Alpine supports S/MIME look at
<A HREF="X-Alpine-Config:">Supported Options in this Alpine</A> and look
for &quot;S/MIME&quot; under the &quot;Encryption&quot; heading.
<P>
Some limitations:
<UL>
   <LI> There is no provision for checking for CRLs
	(Certificate Revocation Lists) in Alpine.
   <LI> This built-in S/MIME implementation is not compatible with and does not help with PGP.
   <LI> There is no mechanism available for feeding either an entire incoming
	or an entire outgoing message to an external
	filter and using that external filter to do S/MIME or PGP processing.
   <LI> Because the implementation currently uses OpenSSL, there is only a very
	limited integration with the Mac OS Keychain (the storing and access of
	public certificates).
</UL>
<P>
The S/MIME configuration screen is reached by going to the Main Menu and typing
the &quot;S&nbsp;Setup&quot; command followed by &quot;M&nbsp;S/MIME&quot;.
<P>

<H2>S/MIME BASICS</H2>

In order to digitally sign messages you send you must have a public/private key-pair.
This may be obtained from a public Certificate Authority (CA) such as Thawte, Verisign, Comodo,
or GoDaddy; or from a smaller CA such as a university which provides certificates for its
users or a company which provides certificates for its workers.
These certificates are bound to an email address, so the identity being verified is the
email address not a person's name.
<P>
Mail is signed by using the sender's private key, which only the owner of the private key
has access to.
The signature is verified using the signer's public key, which anyone can
have access to.
With Alpine, the first time you receive a signed message the public key of the
sender will be stored for future use.

<P>
Mail is encrypted using the recipient's public key and decrypted by
the recipient with their private key.

<P>
You need a key of your own in order to sign outgoing messages and to have others
encrypt messages sent to you.
You do not need a key of your own to verify signed messages sent by others or to
encrypt messages sent to others.

<H2>ALPINE S/MIME CERTIFICATE STORAGE</H2>

By default UNIX Alpine stores the certificates it uses in a directory in your
home directory.
The directory name is
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>.alpine-smime</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
For PC-Alpine, the equivalent directory is called 
<CENTER><SAMP>alpine-smime</SAMP></CENTER>
and is also located under your home directory.
<P>
Within that directory are three subdirectories.
Each of the three subdirectories contains files with PEM-encoded contents,
the default format for OpenSSL.
The &quot;<SAMP>public</SAMP>&quot; directory contains public certificates.
The files within that directory have names that are email addresses with the
suffix &quot;<SAMP>.crt</SAMP>&quot; appended.
An example filename is
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>user@example.com.crt</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The &quot;<SAMP>private</SAMP>&quot; directory contains private keys, probably just one for
your private key.
These are also email addresses but with the suffix &quot;<SAMP>.key</SAMP>&quot; instead.
The third directory is &quot;<SAMP>ca</SAMP>&quot; and it contains certificates for any Certificate
Authorities that you want to trust but that aren't contained in the set of system CAs.
Those files may have arbitrary names as long as they end with the
suffix &quot;<SAMP>.crt</SAMP>&quot;.

<H2>HOW TO SIGN AND ENCRYPT</H2>

If you have a certificate you may sign outgoing messages.
After typing the Ctrl-X command to send a message you will see the prompt
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Send message?</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Available subcommands include &quot;G&nbsp;Sign&quot; and &quot;E&nbsp;Encrypt&quot;.
Typing the &quot;G&quot; command will change the prompt to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Send message (Signed)?</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Typing the &quot;E&quot; command will change the prompt to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Send message (Encrypted)?</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
You may even type both to get
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Send message (Encrypted, Signed)?</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

<H2>HOW TO READ SIGNED OR ENCRYPTED MESSAGES</H2>

The reading of a signed message should not require any special action on
your part.
There should be an editorial addition at the start of the message which
says either
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>This message was cryptographically signed.</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>This message was cryptographically signed but the signature could not be verified.</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If an encrypted message is sent to you the encrypted text will not
be shown.
You will have to type the &quot;Ctrl-D&nbsp;Decrypt&quot; command (from the screen where
you are viewing the message) and supply your passphrase when asked.
<P>
For a signed or encrypted message there is also a &quot;Ctrl-E&nbsp;Security&quot; command
which gives you some information about the certificate used to sign or encrypt the message.

<H2>MISCELLANEOUS</H2>

If you have access to a private certificate in the PKCS12 format, which 
would sometimes be in a file with a &quot;.p12&quot; extension, then you can 
use the following commands to generate private keys, public and certificate
authorities certificates. In the examples below, we assume that the 
certificate in the p12 format is called &quot;certificate.p12&quot;, and 
that your email address is &quot;your@address.com&quot;.

<P>
In order to create a private key use the command
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.p12 -out your@address.com.key</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
In order to create a public certificate use the command
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out your@address.com.crt
</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
In order to create a certificate authority certificate use the command
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.p12 -cacerts -nokeys -out certificate-ca.crt 
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P> If the previous command produces an empty file, it means that the 
certificate authority was not included in the .p12 file, so you will have 
to get it from some other sources. You will need these certificates, so 
that you can validate correctly signatures.

<P>
After you have exported these certificates and keys, you can  use the import 
command in Alpine, from the S/MIME configuration screen,
to import these certificates into Alpine. They will be available for use
as soon as you import them.

This option gives you a way to store keys remotely on an IMAP server
instead of storing the keys one per file locally.
In order to do that you just give this option a remote folder name for a folder
which does not yet exist.
The name is similar to the name you might use for a remote configuration file.
A remote folder name might look something like:

CACert is a shorthand name for certification authority certificate.
Normally Alpine will use the CACerts that are located in the standard system
location for CACerts.
It may be the case that one of your correspondents has a Digital ID which has
been signed by a certificate authority that is not in the regular set of system certificate
authorities.
You may supplement the system list by adding further certificates of your own.
These should  be stored in the directory
which is the value of this option.
The certificates will be stored in PEM format, one certificate per file.
The names of the files can be anything ending in &quot;.crt&quot;.
<P>
Use the Setup/SMIME screen to modify this variable.
<P>
These PEM format CA certificates look very similar to your public
certificates for particular email addresses
(<A HREF="h_config_smime_pubcertdir"><!--#echo var="VAR_smime-public-cert-directory"--></A>).

<P>
This feature only has an effect if your version of Alpine includes
support for S/MIME.
It affects Alpine's behavior when you validate a message, and should
not be disabled, unless you are performing a test.
<P>
There are two important aspects of validation: validation of the message
(that is, the message was not modified after it was sent) 
as well as validation of the identity of the sender. This option has to 
do with the latter. 
<P>
In order to validate that the message came from the sender in the message
and not an impersonator, Alpine can 
either use the certificates that come in the message, or the ones that 
you have personally stored. If this feature is enabled (the default) then 
Alpine will use certificates that you have already saved in your store 
and not those that come in the message to validate the sender of the 
message. In particular, the first time that you receive a signed message
from a sender, and their certificate does not validate against your
store, then you will be asked if you wish to save such certificate. If
you do not wish to save the certificate, then Alpine will fail to validate
the signature of the message. Otherwise, Alpine will proceed to validate
the signature of the message. This behavior helps you prevent against impersonation, because 
it is assumed that you trust the certificates that you have saved, and 
might not trust those that came with the message that you are validating.

This menu item allows you to manage your public certificates, this

certificates of people you correspond with. These certificates are
saved by Alpine automatically when they are found in signed messages
that you receive. This interface allows you to manage them, by
giving you the option to delete them, or trust them (in the case
of self-signed certificates).

<P>
Please note that Alpine will not validate a message that was sent to you
using a self-signed certificate, unless you decide to trust that certificate.
Internally, a certificate is trusted by copying it to the
<A HREF="h_config_smime_certificate_authorities">Certificate Authorities</A> 
collection. If you decide that you want to stop trusting a self-signed
certificate, you must delete such certificate from such collection.

<P>
This option allows you to manage the certificates that are used to
encrypt and decrypt your password file. This is useful in case you
want to change the certificates used to encrypt your password file.
<P>
Depending on the version of Alpine that you used for the first time
to set this up, you might have had to enter a password to enter this
screen. In the case that you did not enter a password to enter this
screen, you should know two things that are important:
<UL>
<LI> If anyone takes control of your computer (for example, if you 
left it unattended) then that person can add a password to your
password file and make it unreadable to you in the future.
<LI> If anyone can access your computer (this includes remote access)
then that person can steal your password file and decrypt it without
your help. This gives access to that person to the same services you
have access and such person can use your name to access that service.
In particular, that person can try to hack into your service provider
with your name on it, or that person could try to send spam with
your name.
</UL>
<P> Needless to say, this is not advisable. You should keep your
password file protected. In order to do so, all you need to do is use
the &quot;Create Key&quot; command to create a key. Once you do this,
Alpine will use that key, encrypted with the password used to create that
key, to protect your password file.
<P>
In this screen you can import a new key to encrypt your password file, 
and read cryptographic information on your current key.
<P>
To import a new key press &quot;RETURN&quot; and enter the location of
the new key. You will be asked to enter the password of the new key. If
this part of the process is successful, Alpine will search for the 
certificate that matches that key. If your key is named 
&quot;your_email@address.com.key&quot;, then Alpine will look for your
certificate in the same directory in the file named
&quot;your_email@address.com.crt&quot;, otherwise it will look for it
as part of your key (that is, it will look to see if your certificate
is in the file &quot;your_email@address.com.key&quot;), if all of this
fails, Alpine will ask you to enter the location of the certificate
that matches the key you unlocked. If a certificate is found, it will be 
used, and in this case, the password file will be read, decrypted with the 
old key and encrypted with the new key. Once this is done, the new key and 
certificates are saved, and the old keys are permanently deleted.
<P>
Alpine does not create a backup of your password file, or your old keys
that will be replaced. If you need to keep old copies, you will have to do
this operation outside Alpine.
<P>
Observe that you can use this screen to remove the password for the key.
As explained earlier, this is not advisable, but you can always restore the
password to encrypt your password file by creating a new key.
<P>
Be safe and keep your password file encrypted with a password.

<H1>S/MIME: Certificate Information Screen</H1>

<P>
The CERTIFICATE INFORMATION screen shows you information contained in a certificate
such as its owner, e-mail address, issuer, and interval of validity, 
among others.
<P>
In the case of public certificates, this screen shows you if there was a
failure when attempting to validate such message. If the certificate is
self-signed, then the <B>T</B> Trust command will be available, which
you can use to trust such certificate and make Alpine not fail validating 
signatures signed with such certificate.
<P>
You can also mark a certificate deleted, with the <B>D</B> command, or 
remove the deleted mark with the <B>U</B> undelete command.
<P>
In the case of your private key, Alpine shows you the information
from your public key. Additionally, Alpine allows you to see public
and private information about your key, with the <B>B</B> and
<B>R</B> commands respectively.

<H1>S/MIME: Commands that Manage Public Certificates</H1>

<P>
This screen allows you to manage your public certificates. 
<P>
The format of this screen is as follows. There are five fields: The 
leftmost field is normally empty, but it could contain the letter 
&quot;D&quot; to indicate that that certificate has been marked for 
deletion. The next field is the e-mail address of the owner of the 
certificate, shown in its entirety. The third and fourth field are the 
first and last day validity for that certificate, respectively. The date
is displayed in the user's locale unless the option 
<A HREF="h_config_disable_index_locale_dates"><!--#echo var="FEAT_disable-index-locale-dates"--></A>
is set. In this case, the month, day and year are represented by two
digits, and the format used is mm/dd/yy. Finally, the fifth 
field is what can be displayed of the MD5 hash of the certificate. You can 
use any of the last three fields to distinguish between two certificates 
for the same owner.
<P>
Available commands in this screen and a short description of what they 
do follows.
<UL>
<LI> <B>I</B> Imports a public certificate to this collection.
<LI> <B>V</B> View information about a certificate such as the name of the person the
certificate was issued to, its dates of validity, and validity status.
<LI> <B>D</B> Marks a certificate deleted.
<LI> <B>U</B> Removes the deletion mark on a certificate.
<LI> <B>X</B> Removes all certificates marked deleted permanently (cannot be undone).
<LI> <B>T</B> This command is only available for self-signed certificates, and allows you to
trust a certificate by copying it to the collection of trusted certificates.

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-lame-list-mode"--></H1>

This feature modifies the method Alpine uses to ask your IMAP
server for folder names to display in the FOLDER LIST screen.
It is intended to compensate for a small set of IMAP servers that
are programmed to ignore a part of the request, and thus respond
to Alpine's query with nonsensical results.
<P>

If you find that Alpine is erroneously displaying blank folder lists,
try enabling this feature.
<P>

NOTE: Enabling this feature has consequences for the Goto and Save
commands.  Many servers allow access to folders outside the area
reserved for your personal folders via some reserved character,
typically '#' (sharp), '~' (tilde) or '/' (slash).  This mechanism
allows, at the Goto and Save prompts, quick access to folders
outside your personal folder collection without requiring a specific
collection definition.  This behavior will generally not be available
when this feature is enabled.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-multiple-newsrcs"--></H1>

This feature makes it so Alpine can use multiple newsrcs based on
the news server being connected to, which allows for separate lists
of subscribed-to newsgroups. When this feature is not set, there is only
one list of newsgroups.
<P>
Under this feature, the name of a newsrc is based on the news server.
For example, if your <a href="h_config_newsrc_path"><!--#echo var="VAR_newsrc-path"--></a>
is set to &quot;.newsrc&quot;, and the news server you are connecting to is
news.example.com, then the newsrc to be used is .newsrc-news.example.com.
Setting this feature for the first time will allow for the option of using
your old newsrc the next time you read news.
<P>
If this feature is set, then the feature
<A HREF="h_config_mulnews_as_typed"><!--#echo var="FEAT_mult-newsrc-hostnames-as-typed"--></A>
also may affect the name of the newsrc file that is used.

Here are the choices:

<DL>
<DT><EM>A</EM>ddress List</DT>
<DD>
The addresses from the address book entries you are saving
from will be saved one address per line.
Address book lists (those with more than one address) will have
all of their addresses saved separately.

The entries will be saved in tab-separated columns.
There will be just 4 columns of data that correspond to Alpine's
Nickname field, Full Name field, Address field, and Comment field.
It might prove useful to Select only the Simple, non-List address book
entries before Saving.

<H1>FEATURE: <!--#echo var="FEAT_predict-nntp-server"--></H1>

This feature allows Alpine to assume that the open NNTP server at the
time of composition is the NNTP server to which the message should be
posted.  This is especially recommended when there are multiple News
collections.  If this feature is not set, Alpine will try to post to the first server in
the <a href="h_config_nntp_server"><!--#echo var="VAR_nntp-server"--></a> variable.  Setting
this feature also negates the need to add News collection servers to
the <!--#echo var="VAR_nntp-server"--> variable.

This feature can be especially handy when used in conjunction with
<a href="h_config_enable_mulnewsrcs"><!--#echo var="FEAT_enable-multiple-newsrcs"--></a>.

This feature should probably be turned on unless it causes trouble.
The results of the NNTP overview command (XOVER) may be used to help

It should result in quicker response time.
Turning this feature on apparently causes search results which are

This feature affects how a threading sort arranges threads.  The default way
to arrange threads is by the date of the earliest message in the thread.
This feature arranges threads by the last message to arrive in a thread.

<P>
This configuration setting specifies the number of horizontal characters
used to format various WebAlpine pages.  Smaller values will tend to reduce
the amount of horizontal scrolling required to view pages within narrow
browsers, such as those found on PDAs, and larger values will tend to 
spread more information across the page.

<P>
The Message List page uses the width to determine how many characters
to assign each field.  Note, a smaller value may result in a disproportionate
amount of blank space between fields on each line.  Similarly, a large
value may result in cramped fields or horizontal scrolling.

<P>
The Message View page uses this value to determine when to wrap lines
in displayed message text.  Note, a smaller value may result in jagged
right margins or confusing quoting.  A larger value may cause lines of text to
run beyond the browser's right edge, requiring horizontal scrolling.
