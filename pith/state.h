/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
   This structure sort of takes the place of global variables or perhaps
is the global variable.  (It can be accessed globally as ps_global.  One
advantage to this is that as soon as you see a reference to the structure
you know it is a global variable. 
   In general it is treated as global by the lower level and utility
routines, but it is not treated so by the main screen driving routines.
Each of them receives it as an argument and then sets ps_global to the
argument they received.  This is sort of with the thought that things
might be coupled more loosely one day and that Pine might run where there
is more than one window and more than one instance.  But we haven't kept
up with this convention very well.
