<p>You can organize your mail into folders. Folders are displayed in the left pane. Some folders are provided by default:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inbox.</strong> Stores and displays your mail messages when they arrive, unless you have routed messages to another folder. You can drag and drop messages from the Inbox to other folders.</li>
  <li><strong>Drafts.</strong> Stores any messages that have been saved during an editing session.</li>
  <li><strong>Sent.</strong> By default, stores copies of all of your sent mail.</li>
  <li><strong>Junk.</strong> Stores messages that have been caught by spam filtering and messages that you add by clicking <strong>Report Spam</strong> on the menu bar. On a weekly basis, Alpine deletes everything in the Junk folder that is dated before the previous week.</li>
  <li><strong>Trash.</strong> Stores deleted messages, where they can be recovered until they are permanently removed. For more information, see <a href="quick-start.html#trash">Trash</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Recent Folders.</strong> This is a listing of the folders that you have opened recently. You can set the number of recent folders displayed in the left pane. For more information, see <a href="settings.html#folders">Settings</a>.<br />
  </li><br />
