<p>When you first log in to your mail account, you see your Inbox. Your Inbox stores and displays your mail messages.</p>
<p>The main body of the display consists of one line per message. By default, your Inbox displays 25 messages on each page. Use the arrows at the right end of the menu bar or at the bottom of the browser window to move from page to page in the list.</p>
<p>To change the number of messages displayed per page, see <a href="settings.html#display">Settings</a>.</p>
<p>There is a checkbox at the start of each message line. To select a set of messages on which to perform an action (for example, Deleting) click in the checkbox. The checkbox at the top of the column selects/unselects all of the messages on the page.</p>

<h2><a name="sort" id="sort"></a>Sorting messages</h2>
